'''Pratapgad''' (also transcribed '''Pratapgarh''' or '''Pratapgadh''') ({{lang-en|Valour fort}}) is a large fort located in [[Satara district]], in the state of [[Maharashtra]] in [[India]]. Significant as the site of the [[Battle of Pratapgad]], the fort is now a popular tourist destination.

==Geography==
Pratapgad fort is located 15 kilometres from [[Poladpur]] and 22 kilometres from [[Mahabaleshwar]], a popular [[hill station]] in the area. This fort stands 1,080 metres above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaharashtraGazeeter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/SATARA/places_Pratapgad.html|title=Pratapgad Fort|accessdate=2008-08-23|work=Satara District Gazetteer|publisher=Government of Maharashtra, Gazetteers Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar.

==History==

The [[Maratha]] king [[Shivaji Maharaj]] commissioned [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]], his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the [[Nira River|Nira]] and the [[Koyna River|Koyna]] rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was completed in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaharashtraGazeeter&quot; /&gt;

The [[Battle of Pratapgarh]] between Shivaji and [[Afzal Khan (general)|Afzal Khan]] was fought below the rampants of this fort on November 10, 1659. This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage of the establishment of the [[Maratha empire]].

Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics. Sakharam Bapu, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival [[Nana Phadnis]] in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he finally died at [[Raigad fort|Raigad]]. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of [[Daulatrao Shinde]] and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to [[Mahad]].

In 1818, as part of the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation. This was a great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold, had a large garrison, and could suppress much of the country round Wai.

A 17-foot high equestrian bronze statue of [[Shivaji]] was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India, on the 30th of November 1957, the same year a road was constructed by the Public Works Department from Kumbhrosi village up to fort. A guest house and a national park were built inside the fort in 1960.

The fort is currently owned by uday Raje Bhosale, the heir of the Satara princely state.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19981128/33350414.html|title= Udayan Raje Bhosale|accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The fort can be divided into the lower fort and upper fort.

The upper fort was built upon the crest of the hill. It is roughly square, 180m long on each side. It has several permanent buildings, including a temple to the god [[Shiva|Mahadev]]. It is located at the northwest of the fort, and is surrounded by sheer cliffs with drops of up to 250m.

The lower fort is around 320m long and 110m wide. It is located at the southeast of the fort, and is defended by towers and bastions ten to twelve metres high.

The Afzal tower extends out from the fort proper and defends the approach to the fort. It is said to have been constructed after the [[Battle of Pratapgad]], and Afzal Khan's head is said to be buried under the tower.

In 1661, Shivaji Raje was unable to visit the temple of the goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur. He decided to dedicate a temple to the goddess at this fort itself. This temple is on the eastern side of the lower fort. The hall has been rebuilt since the original construction, and consists of wooden pillars about 50' long, 30' broad and 12' high. The shrine is made of stone, and contains a clothed black stone image of the goddess. The roof of the temple is flat inside, but covered in lead covering put up by the Satara Raja Pratapsinh (1818â€“1839). A small spire or ''[[shikhar]]'' covers the shrine.

A [[dargah]] of Afzal Khan is located a short while away from the fort to the south-east.

==Tourism==
Pratapgad is usually visited as a day-trip from [[Mahabaleshwar]], a popular tourist destination located 25 kilometres away.

One can take ST from Panvel to Poladpur at night &amp; then stay at Poladpur ST stand for the first ST to WADA (Base village). Its around 7am. When you reach at Wada village you can hire a 4 wheeler to the base of the Fort. But there is an alternate fantastic trekking road surrounded by greenery, for that you have to ask villagears 1st.(its bit hidden). But if you first go by main road by walking then you can see an arrow on the road showing the exact path &amp; after that you can see old rock stairs. From this rout you can go walking in around 1/2 hrs to the top of the fort. (total time 1.1/2hrs). This was the old rout of mawlas in anciant time. The main road was built by governament when bronze statue of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was placed on the fort. Or they made it wide.

'''Murud-Janjira''' ({{audio|Murud-Janjira.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the local name for a fort situated on an island just off the coastal village of Murud, in the [[Raigad district]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dale&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoiberg|first=Dale|coauthors=Indu Ramchandani|title=Students' Britannica India|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2000|pages=403|isbn=0-85229-762-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-xzljvnQ1vAC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;dq=murud+janjira+fort&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA403,M1|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was occupied by the [[Siddi]]s and is famous for being the only fort along India's Western coast that remained undefeated despite [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[English East India Company]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murud Janjira|url=http://www.murudjanjira.in/|accessdate=19 january 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==
[[File:Janjiraushnish2.jpg|thumb|Janjira from outside]]
The word Janjira is not native to India, and may have originated after the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Jazeera'', which means an island. Murud was once known in Marathi as ''Habsan'' (&quot;of [[Habshi]]&quot; or Abyssinian). The name of the fort is a concatenation of the Konkani and Arabic words for Island, &quot;morod&quot; and &quot;jazeera&quot;. The word &quot;morod&quot; is peculiar to Konkani and is absent in Marathi.

== Major features ==

Murud-Janjira Fort is situated on an oval-shaped rock off the Arabian Sea coast near the port town of Murud, {{convert|165|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Mumbai]]. Janjira is considered one of the strongest marine forts in India.  The fort is approached by sailboats from Rajapuri jetty. The main gate of the fort faces Rajapuri on the shore and can be seen only when one is quite close to it.  It has a small postern gate towards the open sea for escape.  

The fort has 19 rounded bastions, still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make rusting on the bastions.  Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the necessary facilities, e.g., palaces, quarters for officers, mosque, two big fresh water tank, etc.  On the outer wall flanking the main gate, there is a sculpture depicting a tiger-like beast clasping elephants in its claws. There are prominent &quot;ASHOK-CHAKRAS&quot; on all major gates of the fort Janjira. There are images of playing elephants, lions etc. [[File:Janjira-fort-gate-tiger-elephant.jpg|thumb|The sculpture on the main gate]]
The palace of the Nawabs of Janjira at Murud is still in good shape. The palace was self-sufficient and must have support of the locals. It has secret gates to hide and escape. Its construction is unique and very strong.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Originally the fort was a small wooden structure built by a [[Koli]] chief in the late 15th century. It was captured by Pir Khan, a general of Nizamshah of [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmednagar]].  Later, the fort was strengthened by Malik Ambar, the Abyssinian-origin [[Siddi]] regent of Ahmednagar kings.  From then onward, Siddis became independent, owing allegiance to Adilshah and the Mughals as dictated by the times.The last surviving prince Roby Philip lives in New york.

== History ==
[[File:Janjiraushnish3.jpg|thumb|Inside the fort]]

The fort was originally  built in 15th century on a smaller scale by a local Maratha-Fisherman Chieftain- Ram Patil  to protect his people from pirates/ thieves and was known as &quot; Medhekot&quot;. He was a fearless man with independent bent of mind who was quite popular with the local fishermen. Nizam, the ruler from Ahmadnagar  sent one of his Siddi commanders Piram Khan, who came with three ships armed with necessary weapons and soldiers and captured the fort. Piram Khan was succeeded by Burhan Khan, who demolished the original fort and built an impregnable much bigger, 22 acre, stone fort sometime in between 1567 and 1571. The fort was called 'Jazeere Mahroob Jazeera ' which in Arabic means an Island. Siddhi Ambersatak was nominated as Commander of the fort. 

Despite their repeated attempts, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[Marathas]] failed to subdue the power of the Siddi's, who were themselves allied with the [[Mughal Empire]]. Major historical figures from Murud-Janjira include men such as [[Yahya Saleh]] and [[Sidi Yaqub]]. The fort has a tunnel which opens in Rajpuri. The fort was made by a mixture of lead, sand and gul.  

The [[Maratha]]s led by [[Shivaji]] attempted to scale the 12 meters high [[Granite]] walls but failed in all his attempts. His son [[Sambhaji]] even attempted to tunnel his way into the fort but was unsuccessful in all his attempts.&lt;ref&gt;India, Lonely Planet&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Janjiraushnish4.jpg|thumb|Janjira ruins]]
[[File:Janjiraushnish6.jpg|thumb|The small pond inside Janjira fort]]
In the year 1736, [[Siddi]]s of Murud-Janjira set out to recapture [[Raigarh]] from the ravaging forces of Baji Rao, on 19 April 1736, Chimnaji attacked the gathering forces in the encampments of the [[Siddi]]s during the [[Battle of Riwas]] near Riwas, when the confrontation ended 1500 Siddi's including their leader Siddi Sat were killed. Peace was concluded in September 1736, but the Siddis were confined to [[Janjira]], [[Gowalkot]] and Anjanwel.

'''Shivneri Fort''' is a historic military [[fortification]] located near [[Junnar]]. It is the birthplace of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gun&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat tracks in Maharashtra|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2003|pages=69|isbn=81-7154-669-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JIjmDLardesC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=shivneri+fort&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=shivneri%20fort&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Shahaji]], Chatrapati Shivaji's father, was a general in the army of the [[Adil Shah]], [[Sultan]] of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]]. He was concerned for the safety of his wife [[Jijabai]] during her pregnancy as there was constant warfare going on. He therefore moved his family to Shivneri fort. Shivneri is a highly defensible location, with steep rocks on four sides and a strongly built citadel. 

Chhatrapati Shivaji was born at the fort on 19 February 1630, and spent his childhood there.he got his name SHIVBA here. Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to the goddess Shivai Devi, after whom '''[[Shivaji]]''' was named. 

There are statues of Jijabai and young Shivaji. At the centre of the fort is a water pond which is called 'Badami 
Talav'. To the South of 'Badami Talav' are the statues Jijabai and a young Shivaji.  In the fort there are two water springs, called Ganges and Yamuna, which have water throughout the whole year. Two kilometers away from this fort there are the [[Lenyadri]] caves which is one of [[Ashtavinayak]] temple in Maharastra. It has been declared as a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf |title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise}}

'''Sindhudurg''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] à¤¸à¤¿à¤‚à¤§à¥à¤¦à¥à¤°à¥à¤—) is a fortress which occupies an islet in the [[Arabian Sea]], just off the coast of [[Maharashtra]] in western [[India]].  The fortress lies on the shore of [[Malvan]] town of [[Sindhudurg District]] in the [[Konkan]] region of Maharashtra, south of [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/Forts.aspx?strpage=SindhudurgFort.html|title= Sindhudurg Fort Location|accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise|url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural details==
[[Image:Sindhudurg Fort India.jpg|thumb|The Watch Tower facing the sea]]
Over 4000 mounds of iron were used in the casting and foundation stones were firmly laid down. Construction started on 25 November 1664. Built over a period of three years (1664â€“67), the sea fort is spread over {{convert|48|acre|m2}} with a two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) long rampart, and walls that are {{convert|30|ft|m}} high and {{convert|12|ft|m}} thick. The massive walls were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and tides of the Arabian Sea. The main entrance is concealed in such a way that no one can pinpoint it from outside.

At a time when Samudra Gaman (travelling by sea) was banned by scriptures, this construction on an island represents the revolutionary mindset of its engineer

==Permanent residents==
The number of permanent residents staying in the fort has been in decline since the fort's abandonment. Most of the residents moved out because of inadequate employment opportunities, but over 15 families remain in the fort. The Sakpal Naik family (the original 'killedars') still resides in one of the 16 houses in the fort. However, Dr Sarang Kulkarni's underwater discoveries have led to the establishment of the Indian sub-continent's only well-established scuba-diving industry. This has provided the local residents with some employment. ''Sindhudurg'' fort is a popular summer destination for Indian and foreign tourists to explore the island and go scuba-diving and snorkelling to view the coral reef on the outskirts of the island.

==How to reach Sindhudurg==
Sindhudurg town lies in the Sindudurg district to the north of Goa, about 490&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Mumbai]] ([[Bombay]]). Sindhudurg can be reached either by train or by bus from [[Bombay]], [[Goa]] and [[Mangalore]]. The [[Konkan railway]] has a railway station at Sindhudurg, but only few trains stop there. Kudal, Kanakvali and Sawantwadi are major railway stations in Sindhudurg district. There are Maharashtra state government (MSRTC) buses running from [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]], [[Ratnagiri]], [[Sangli]], [[Kolhapur]] and Goa state government buses (Kadamba Transport Corporation) running from [[Panaji]], [[Madgaon]], [[Vasco]] and [[Pernem]] to Sindhudurg.
Nearest airport is Dabholim (Goa) airport, which is located at approx. 90 Km away from Sawantwadi City (major tourist attraction) of Sindhudurg.

==Attractions at the fort==
# There are three sweet water reservoirs in the fort ramparts. Even if the water in the nearby villages dries up in summer, these wells always contain water.
# There is a coconut tree which has a branch and also gives fruit. (No other coconut tree has a branch.) The tree was struck by lightning a couple of years ago.
# There is a hidden passage (that starts in a temple that looks like a water reservoir) that goes under the island for 3&amp;nbsp;km, under the sea for 12&amp;nbsp;km, and from there 12&amp;nbsp;km to a nearby village. The tunnel was used as an escape route for the women if the enemy entered the fort. However, the British partially closed this passage after the fort was abandoned.
# The entrance gate is almost invisible, and only regular visitors are likely to find it.
# A handprint and a footprint of Shivaji Maharaj is also embedded in one section of the fort. There is also Atmeshwar Mandir, a famous Shivling, and is beautiful place for ''adhyatmik sadhana'' (spiritual activities).
# There is the only temple of Shivaji Maharaj in the world; the temple was built by Shivaji's son Rajaram. Festivities such as ''Shivaji Jayanti'' (birthday of Shivaji), Ram Navami, Janmashtami, Mahashivrathri, Ganesh Chaturthi, are celebrated.
# Daily ''puja'' (worship)and maintenance is done by mainly two families that were assigned this job since the fort was built; one of them is Shriram Sapkal.
# Along with the navy, Shivaji maharaj also realized the importance of a sea fort. One of the sea fort that he built was this Sindhudurga Fort at Malvan.

'''Daulatabad''' is a 14th century fort city in [[Maharashtra]], India, about 16 kilometers northwest of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]. The place, was once as known as '''Deogiri''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Devagiri Daulatabad Fort|url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/Forts.aspx?strpage=DevagiriDaulatabadFort.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (circa the sixth century AD, when it was an important uplands city along caravan routes and is now but a village, based around the former city of the same name.

Starting 1327, it famously remained the capital of [[Tughlaq dynasty]], under [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] (r. 1325-1351), who also changed its name, and forcibily moved the entire population of [[Delhi]] here, for two years, before it was abandoned due to lack of water.

There is a tradition that Deoghur or Doulatabad was built in 1203 AD by a [[Dhangar]] or herdsman who acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth was named by his brother shepherds Rajah Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Rajah.&lt;ref&gt;The Asiatic journal and monthly register for British and foreign India, pg 355. Published in 1827.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''FORT OF DEOGIRI''==
The area of the city includes the hill-fortress of '''Devagiri''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] à¤¦à¥‡à¤µà¤—à¤¿à¤°à¥€) (sometimes Latinised to Deogiri). It  stands on a conical hill, about 200 meters high. Much of the lower slopes of the hill has been cut away by  [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadava dynasty]] rulers to leave 50 meter vertical sides to improve defenses. The fort is a place of extraordinary strength. The only means of access to the summit is  by a narrow bridge, with passage for not more than two people abreast, and a long gallery, excavated in the rock, which has for the most part a very gradual upward slope.

About midway along  this gallery, the access gallery has steep stairs, the top of which is covered by a grating destined in time of war to form the hearth of a huge fire kept burning by the garrison above. At the summit, and at intervals on the slope, are specimens of massive old cannon facing out over the surrounding countryside. Also at the mid way, there is a cave entrance meant to confuse the enemies.

==The City==
Daulatabad (190 57â€™ N; 750 15â€™ E) is located at a distance of 15&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Aurangabad, the district headquarters and midway to Ellora group of caves.
The original widespread capital city is now mostly unoccupied and has been reduced to a village. Much of its survival depends on the tourists to the old city and the adjacent fort.

===History===
The site had been occupied since at least 100 BCE, and now has remains of Buddhist caves similar to those at [[Ajanta]] and [[Ellora]].

[[Image:Aurangabad - Daulatabad Fort (95).JPG|thumb|255px|left|Daulatabad Fort -- '''Devagiri''' (Deogiri).]]
The city is said to have been founded c. 1187 by Bhillama V, a prince who renounced his allegiance to the [[Chalukya]]s and established the power of the Yadava dynasty in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fort of Daulatabad |last= Qureshi |first= Dulari |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2004 |publisher= Bharatiya Kala Prakashan |location= New Delhi |isbn= 81-8090-072-X|page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=u15uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=fort+of+daulatabad&amp;dq=fort+of+daulatabad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a_seUZneMYid2QWjrYDADA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |accessdate= March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shah Jahan watches the assault on Daulatabad Fort in 1633.jpg|thumb|Capture of Daulatabad Fort in 1633]]
Daulatabad or â€˜the abode of wealthâ€™ was the name given by Muhammad-bin-Tughluq when he made his capital here in A.D. 1327. The ancient name being â€˜Devagiriâ€™ or â€˜Deogiriâ€™ meaning â€˜Hill of Godsâ€™ under the Yadavas of Deogiri. The Yadavas were initially ruling under the Chalukyas of Kalyani over region of modern Dhulia and Nasik districts with their capital at Chandradityapura (modern Chandor, Nasik district). Bhillama V who was one of the powerful Yadava rulers led victorious campaigns against the Hoysalas, Paramaras and Chalukyas founded the city of Deogiri and shifted his capital here. Since then the succeeding Yadava rulers held their capital here. During the rule of Ramachandradeva, son of Krishna, Ala-ud-din Khilji invaded and captured Deogiri in A.D. 1296. However, Ramachandradeva was allowed to rule from here as a vassal. Later, Malik Kafur led two campaigns against Ramachandradeva and his son Shankardeva in A.D. 1306-07 and 1312 respectively; Shankardeva was killed during the latter campaign. Harapaladeva was placed on the throne by Malik Kafur who later ascertained his independence. This led to another successful campaign against Deogiri by Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah Khilji and the fort was annexed to the Delhi Sultanate. Muhammad-bin-Tughluq succeeded the Khiljis at Delhi and he renamed Deogiri as Daulatabad and seeing its impregnable fort, shifted the capital from Delhi in A.D. 1328. This led to serious repercussions and he had to again transfer the capital back to Delhi. The region and the fort passed on into the hands of Bahamani rulers under Hasan Gangu in A.D. 1347 and Nizam Shahis of [[Ahmednagar]] in A.D. 1499. Daulatabad became the capital of Nizam Shah dynasty in 1607 A.D. Deccan witnessed turbulent periods due to the frequent invasions and infights between the local ruling families during this period. The [[Mughals]] led several campaigns during the rule of Akbar and Shah Jahan and only during the latterâ€™s period the area was fully captured in 1633 A.D. after a long siege of four months. Thus the Mughals seized power and [[Aurangazeb]] was placed as the Viceroy of Deccan who led his campaigns to Bijapur and Golconda from Daulatabad. The rising power of [[Marathas]] troubled the [[Mughals]] and for a brief period the region passed under the control of Marathas. Thus the Daulatabad fort passed several hands, captured and re-captured, by the Mughals, the Marathas, the Peshwas, and finally placed under the control of the Nizams of Hyderabad in 1724 A.D. which was under their control till independence.

==Monuments==
The outer wall, {{convert|2.75|mi|km}} in circumference, once enclosed the ancient city of Deogiri (Devagiri), and between this and the base of the upper fort are three lines of defences.

Besides the fortifications Daulatabad contains several notable monuments, of which the chief are the Chand Minar and the Chini Mahal.  The Chand Minar is a tower {{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high and {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in circumference at the base, and was originally covered with beautiful [[Persian Empire|Persian]] glazed tiles.  It was erected in 1445 by Ala-ud-din [[Bahmani]] to commemorate his capture of the fort.  The Chini Mahal, or China Palace, is the ruin of a building once of great beauty.  In it Abul Hasan [[Tana Shah]], the last of the [[Qutb Shahi]] kings of [[Golconda]], was imprisoned by Aurangzeb in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fort of Daulatabad |last= Qureshi |first= Dulari |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2004 |publisher= Bharatiya Kala Prakashan |location= New Delhi |isbn= 81-8090-072-X|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

===Road Transport===
Daulatabad is in the outskirts of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], and is on the Aurangabad - [[Ellora]] road (National Highway 211). Aurangabad is well connected by road, rail and air.

===Rail Transport===
Daulatabad rail station is located on the Kachiguda-Manmad section of the [[Nanded Division]] of [[South Central Railway]]. Until reorganisation in 2003, it was a part of the [[Hyderabad Division]] Aurangabad is a major station near to Daulatabad.

'''Harishchandragad''' is a [[Forts in India|hill fort]] in the [[Ahmednagar]] region of [[India]].  Its history is linked with that of [[Malshej Ghat]],kothale village and it  has played a major role in guarding and controlling the 
surrounding region.

==History==
The fort is quite ancient. Remnants of Microlithic man have been discovered here. The various Puranas (ancient scriptures) like Matsyapurana, Agnipurana and Skandapurana include many references about Harishchandragad. Its origin is said to have been in 6th century, during the rule of Kalchuri dynasty. The citadel was built during this era. The various caves probably have been carved out in the 11th century. In these caves are idols of Lord Vishnu. Though the cliffs are named Taramati and Rohidas, they are not related to Ayodhya. Great sage [[Changdev]] (one who created the epic â€œTatvasaarâ€), used to meditate here in 14th century. The caves are from the same period. The various constructions on the fort and those existing the surrounding region point to the existence of diverse cultures here. The carvings on the temples of Nageshwar (in Khireshwar village), in the Harishchandreshwar temple and in the cave of Kedareshwar indicate that the fort belongs to the medieval period, since it is related to Shaiva, Shakta or Naath.
Later the fort was under the control of Moguls. The Marathas captured it in 1747.
[[Image:Harishchandragad Pano4.jpg|800px|thumb|center|A panoramic view from the basement]]

==Fascinating Spots==
===Saptatirtha Pushkarni===
To the east of the temple is a well-built lake called â€œSaptatirthaâ€. On its bank are temple-like constructions in which there are idols of Lord Vishnu. Recently these idols have been shifted in the caves near the temple of Harishchandreshwar. These days many trekkers have been responsible for the sad plight of this beautiful place, as they throw plastic wastes and other things in the pond. 7 years back the water was potable, and now it isn't suitable even to swim. (but one thing is sure this water is so chill  in summer also that you can actually fill like you are standing in refrigeration unit.)  

[[Image:Kedareshwar.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Kedareshwar Cave. Local legend holds that when the fourth pillar breaks, the world will come to an end.]]

===Kedareshwar Cave===
Going rightwards of Harishchandreshwar temple, we come across a huge cave. This is the cave of Kedareshwar (''see picture''), in which there is a big Shivlinga, which is totally surrounded by water. The total height from its base is five feet, and the water is waist-deep. It is quite difficult to reach the Shivlinga because the water is ice-cold. There are sculptures carved out here. In monsoon it is not possible to reach this cave, as a huge stream flows across the way.


As you can see from the picture, there is a huge rock above the Shiva Linga. There were 4 pillars built around the Shiva Linga. No one really knows the history about these pillars, but it is said that the pillars were built to depict the four 'Yugas' of Life - 'Satya Yuga', 'Tretha Yuga', 'Dwapara Yuga' and 'Kali Yuga'. When a Yuga comes to the end of its time, one of the pillars apparently breaks down. Three of the pillars have already broken down. The general belief is that the current phase is the 'Kali Yuga' and the day the fourth pillar breaks down - it will be looked to as the last day of the current era. 

Another interesting thing about this place is that water is said to seep into this temple from the four walls on an everyday basis. And owing to the water being very chilly, it's difficult to reach inside too. The water continues to seep in during all the seasons in the year, except during rainy season and surprisingly, it is also said that there is absolutely no water there during rainy seasons alone.

===Konkan Kada (Konkan cliff)===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:konkankada.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Konkan Kada.]] --&gt;

The most interesting point on this fort is this cliff, which has always fascinated many people from many years. The cliff faces west and looks down upon the Konkan. From here, one can have a breathtaking view of the surrounding region and the setting sun. This cliff is not just vertical, it is an overhang, almost like a cobra's hood. It has been climbed many times. Sometimes a circular rainbow (the [[Brocken spectre]] phenomenon) can be seen from this point. It can be seen only when there is a bit of mist in the valley, and the sun is right behind the person facing the valley. One amazing phenomenon that can be observed at this place is the vertical cloud burst, in which the clouds nearing the cliff get sucked into the pit fall area below are thrown vertically into the sky reaching more than {{convert|50|ft|m}}. It creates a magical wall that is rising straight from the edge of the cliff without entering the landmass area.
The fog show and hovering clouds below the cliff complement the season if one visits.

===Taramati peak===
Also known as Taramanchi. This is the topmost point on the fort (1429 meters).  [[Leopards]] are seen in the forests beyond this peak. From here we can have a glimpse of the whole range of [[Naneghat]] and the forts near [[Murbad]].
From this Taramati point,we can have a glimpse of forts till Siddhagad near Bhimashankar in the south and Napta twin peaks,Ghodishep (865 meters),Ajoba (1375 meters),Kulang fort (1471 meters)in the north near the Kasara region
[[Image:Harishchandragadpano6.jpg|500px|thumb|center|A panoramic view from the peak]]

===Caves on Harishchandragad===
These caves are situated all over the fort. Many of these are situated at the foot of Taramati peak &amp; are the place of accommodation. A few are near the temple, whereas some are near the citadel and some far away in the forests. A {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep natural cave is on the northwestern side of the fort, to the right of Kokan Kada. Many other caves are still said to remain undiscovered.

===Nageshwar temple near Khireshwar===
This is a great antique construction, and diverse artistic works are seen on this. On the ceiling of the temple are beautiful carvings. The main attraction of the carvings here is the 1.5 m long sculpture of Lord Vishnu in the sleeping posture, popularly known as &quot;sheshshayi Vishnu&quot; in Marathi. It is rare and hence holds a lot of importance. There are a lot of legends told about this sculpture. There are caves near the temple.

===Temple of Harishchandreshwar===
[[Image:Symptoms of Inner Peace.jpg|thumb|right|Ganapati, Harishchandreshwar Temple]]
This temple is marvelous example of the fine art of carving sculptures out of stones that prevailed in ancient India. It is about 16 m high from its base. Around this temple there a few caves &amp; ancient water tanks. The river Mangal Ganga is said to originate from one of the tanks located close to the temple. The top of the temple resembles construction with the north-Indian temples. A similar temple is situated in Buddha-Gaya. Here we can see many tombs, in which a typical construction is seen. These are built by well-finished arranging stones one on top of the other. There are three main caves near the temple. The cisterns near the temple provide drinking water. A short distance away, another temple called Kashitirtha is located. The fascinating thing about this temple is that it has been carved out from a single huge rock. There are entrances from all four sides. On the main entrance there are sculptures of faces. These are faces of guards of the temple. On the left side of the entrance is a Devnagri inscription, which is about saint Changdev.

==Ways to reach==
Harishchandragad lies where the boundaries of Thane, Pune and Ahmednagar districts converge. 

1) From Thane District:
One has to board the bus for Nagar from Kalyan &amp; alight at â€˜Khubi Phataâ€™. From there we reach the village of Khireshwar by bus or private vehicle. This village is 7&amp;nbsp;km from the foothills of the fort.

2) From Pune District:
There is a daily bus from Swargate (Pune) to Khireswar village.

3) From Ahmednagar District:
One has to board the bus for Nasik or Mumbai &amp; alight at Ghoti village. From Ghoti, we have to board another bus to Sangamner via Malegaon &amp; alight at Rajur village. From here, 2 ways diverge to the fort.
1) From Rajur, one has to board the bus or a private vehicle to the village of Pachanai. From here, the way is straight to the topmost point.
2) Recently, the way from Rajur to kothale(Tolar Khind) has been made available. From Tolar Khind (Tolar valley), the temple is about 2â€“3 hours by walking.
3) from kotul to kothale bus facilities available way to tolar khind every hour bus going towards kothale ,private vehicles also available on this route.

==Hiking to the Fort==
There are 4â€“5 known ways up to the fort, the most usual being the following ones:
===Way from Khireshwar===
The way beside the caves, where water tanks are seen, proceeds further to Junnar Darwaaja (Entrance From Junnar). From here, the route goes straight to Tolar Khind. Walking a few minutes from Tolar Khind, we come across a rock-patch on which railings are fixed. After ascending the railings, we come to the plateau region on which less dense forests are seen. From here, we have to cross 7 hills &amp; after a walk of 2â€“3 hours, we reach the temple of Harishchandreshwar, the temple of Lord Shiva.
Note: On this way, many arrows help in indicating the way.

Also there is one interesting short route if one has to skip the seven hills.By this route,you can reach the temple in 1 hour instead of 2 hours through seven hills but this route goes through very very dense forests hence if you are in group of many people,this route can be tried
After climbing the rock patch from the Tolar Khind,follow the usual trek route going ahead and at one point,you will encounter two ways one to the right goes to the temple through seven hills and the straight one goes below the balekilla (citadel)through very dense forests (the trees are very dense that you can't even view the sky above your head)and this route reaches to the seventh mountain directly.

===Way from Belpada===
The third way is specially meant for hikers, which is via Sadhleghat. One should board the bus for Malshej Ghat &amp; go to the village of Belpada via Savarne village on the Malshej-Kalyan road. From here, the route goes through Sadhleghat. Here one has to climb a straight rock patch on which grips are provided. The temple is situated at a height of about 1&amp;nbsp;km from Belpada. The total distance is about 19&amp;nbsp;km.

===Way from Kothale ===
There is another way to reach Harischandragad is from Kothale village, a village you can reach by buses or private vehicles. Buses coming from Sangamner, Akole or from Kotul. From Kotul the distance is 25 km with buses going every hour towards Kothale. From kothale Harischandragad is 3 km away, from Kothale to Harischandragad you need to go by foot. This way is very beautiful as you enjoy natural beauty of forest. On this way there is a small pond of pure natural water available at that pond. The history of that pond is that some years ago this pond provided water for all cowboys who from came from the nearest villages.
==Accommodation facility==
Ganesh caves, located very near to the Harishchandeshwar Temple. Temple has capacity of providing accommodation up to 50 people. These caves are well maintained by the villagers of Paachnai. People hiking to the other peaks generally rest here during night.

==Food facility==
In summer and winter, arrangement for food cooked by the villagers is available near the caves. However, in monsoon, due to adverse weather conditions villagers do not prefer cooking and serving near the caves. One should make the arrangement himself.

==Drinking water facility==
The water tanks near the caves provide water all round the year for basic needs. The perennial stream running near the caves is the major source for drinking water. It is advisable to refrain from drinking water at the tank near to caves. While in monsoon, there are a number of waterfalls around the caves which provide potable water. Potable water is available from the tanks which are present in the temple compound.

On weekends during Summer and Winter, the villagers sell lemon water and buttermilk at 2â€“3 points between Tolar Khind and Harishchandreshwar. Basic meals are available at 1â€“2 temporary shacks over the weekend.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">[[File:Sudhagad entrance 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance of Sudhagad]]
Sudhagad (also called Bhorapgad) is a [[hill fort]] situated in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It lies about {{convert|53|km|mi}} west of [[Pune]], {{convert|26|km|mi}} south of [[Lonavla]] and {{convert|11|km|mi}} east of [[Pali, Raigad|Pali]] in [[Raigad District]]. The summit is {{convert|620|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;trek&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Sudhagad entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Sudhagad as seen from the higher ramparts of the fort]]

== History ==
The origin of this fort is said to date back to the 2nd century B.C {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the same age as the [[Thanale]] and [[Khadsamble]] caves nearby. It was then called Bhrorapgad (after its presiding deity, Bhoraidevi). In 1436, it was captured by the [[Bahamani]] Sultan. In 1657, the Marathas took over and renamed it &quot;Sudhagad&quot;(''the sweet one''). It was a large fort and Sudhagad was considered by [[Shivaji]] as the capital of his kingdom. He surveyed it, but instead chose [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] because of its central location.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In the regime of the [[Peshwas]], the â€˜Pantsachivasâ€™ of Bhor&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;/&gt; became the custodians of this fort. After the annexation of princely states in 1950 the fort became patron less. As a result, the fort is in a state of ruins, even though it escaped the wrath of the British.
[[File:Sudhagad gates.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sudhagad main entrance]]

== Major Features ==
The first fort has several ruins of two temples dedicated to [[Shiva]]. However, the temple of Bhoraidevi(its patron goddess) is well maintained temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot; /&gt; On the large plateua at the summit,&lt;ref name=&quot;mountain&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohli |first=M.S|title=Mountains of India|publisher=Indus Publishing|date=2004|edition=Illustrated|pages=254|isbn=81-7387-135-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GIs4zv17HHwC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=sudhagad&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA254,M1|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are two lakes, a house, a big granary, some tombs, a shrine (Vrindavan) and numerous other ruins, scattered around the fort area.

[[File:Salher Fort.jpg|thumb|Salher Fort]]

'''Salher''' is a place located near Waghamba in [[Nasik district]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is the site of the highest fort in the [[Sahyadri]] mountains and the second highest peak at {{convert|1567|m|ft|0}} after [[Kalsubai]] in Maharashtra.

==History==
According to a legend, Lord [[Parshuram]] did his [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapascharya]] at [[Salher Fort]]. The twin fort [[Salota]] (4986&amp;nbsp;feet) is very near to Salher.

[[Salher Fort]] was under [[Shivaji]] maharaj in 1671. The [[Mughals]] attacked the fort in 1672. Almost one lakh soldiers fought in this war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trekshitiz.com/EI/EI_DefaultUser.asp?FortName=Salher&lt;/ref&gt; Many soldiers died in this battle but finally Shivaji Maharaj won the battle. Of all the face to face battles between the Mughals and '''Shivaji Maharajâ€™s troops''', the battle of Salher takes first place. Such a big battle was not won before. The bravery and strategy used by the '''Maratha''' troops in the battle spread far and wide and increased Shivaji Maharajâ€™s fame further. After winning Salher, the [[Maratha]]s also captured Mulher and established their reign over the Baglan region. In 18th century the [[Peshwa]]s occupied this fort and later by the [[British Empire|British]].

[[Image:Kolabafort west side.jpg|thumb|Kolaba fort entrance]]
:''For the area in Mumbai see [[Colaba]]''
'''Kolaba Fort''' (sometimes '''Kulaba Fort''') is an old military [[fortification]] in India. It is situated in the sea at a distance of 1â€“2&amp;nbsp;km from the shores of [[Alibag]], 35&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Mumbai]], in the [[Konkan]] region of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is a popular tourist destination and a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf |title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise |}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

== History  ==

The first mention of Kolaba fort is when it was chosen by [[Shivaji]] to be fortified after the whole of South Konkan came under his command. In 1662, he strengthened and fortified Kolaba fort to make it one of his chief naval stations. The command of the fort was given to Darya Sagar and Manik Bhandari under whom Kolaba fort became the centre of Maratha attacks on British ships. &lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; 

In 1713 under a treaty with Peshwa [[Balaji Vishwanath]], Kolaba along with several other forts was given over to [[Kanhoji Angre]]. He used it as his main base from which to launch raids on British ships. In 1722, the Bombay Government incensed at Angre's activities, joined the Portuguese in an expedition against Kolaba. A Portuguese land force and three English ships of the line under Commodore Mathews co-operated but the attempt failed owing to the &quot;cowardice of the Portuguese&quot;. About this time Kolaba is described by Hamilton as a fort built on a rock, a little way from the mainland and at high water an island.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;

== Major features ==

The average height of the fort walls is 25 feet. It has two main entrances, one on the sea side and the other towards Alibag. An interesting feature of this fort is that it has [[freshwater]] wells in its premises even though it is a seaside fort. In the [[monsoons]], the fort can be reached by wading through waist-deep water at low tide. However, at high tide, boats must be used to reach it.

The Siddhivinayak temple inside the fort was built by [[Raghoji Angre]] in 1759.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt Central Press|date=1883|pages=261â€“265|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4bMIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=kolaba+fort&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XEQ-92J7ys&amp;sig=w_2-fmm-YXJNjX0jNRTAyt6prhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA263,M1|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naldurg fort is one of the important ground forts in the Marathawada region. It represents a fine example of the medieval architectural style.

Naldurg was formerly a district headquarters is situated about {{convert|50|km|mi}} south-east of Osmanabad. The fort is an interesting place which encloses a knoll of basalt rock which juts out into the valley of the small Bori River. Along the rest of the cliff on three sides ran fortifications. A bastion is firmly built out of basalt and is large enough to carry heavy guns. The entire circumference is about a mile and a half.

The interior portion is covered with ruined walls and a wide road running up to the centre. The fort has many bastions amongst which are upli Buruj, which is the height point in the Fort Paranda Buruj , nagar Buruj, Sangam Burug, Sangram Buruj, Bands Buruj, poone Buruj, etc. Inside the fort there are remains of the walls and some of the building such as Barood kotha, Baradari, Ambarkhana, and Rangaan mahal, Jali. Though the buildings are in ruins the remains give the impression that there might have been at one time other buildings. There are two tanks in the fort known as machali guns amongst which the most important are the â€œhathi tophâ€ and magar Tophâ€, The hathi Darwaza. The hurmukh and the hurmukh darwaza are the main gates of the fort.An interesting building which connects the fort and the Ranmandala is the dam constructed across the Bori River. The dam and the â€pani mahal&quot; built underneath and in the middle of the dam were built during the reign of Ibrahim Adil shah II In 1613.

It is believed that the fort was built by Nalaraja (The King Nala). The fort and the city is named after him. The fort was built in the period of the [[Chalukya]] kings of [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]]. Later, from 1351 to 1480, in the period of the [Bahamani] kings. In 1558, the Adil Shahi rulers, after the downfall of Adil Shahi Kingdom, Naldurg passed into the hands of Moghalain the year 1686. A.D. Nizamul Mulk Asif Jah was appointed as Governor of the entire Deccan from Central India and Gujrat up to Kanya Kumari. After the death of Aurangzeb Nawab Nizamul Mulk Asif Jah Bahadur founded the Nizam Domanion. During the time of II Nizam The Governor (Subedar) became a rebel and Causing Havoc to the Subject Then the Asif Jah II, Nawab Nizam Ali khan send his Afghan General Mohammed Dulah Khan. General Mohammed Dulah Khan conquered the province crushed the mutiny and took the traitor into his custody. Nizam the II Appointed Nawab Mohammed Dulah khan Bahabdur as a Governor (Subedar) with the title of Nawab Karar Nawaz Jung Bahadur. Then his son Nawab Amir Nawazul Mulk Bahabdur became the Governor of Naladrug. He ruled very successfully. He was not only kindhearted but generous when there was a theft of 1 1/2 Quintal gold from the Tulja Bhawani Temple. He donated the gold from his personal treasure to compensate. 
The most important historical marriage which took place at Naldrug Fort at Rang Mahal was the marriage of Chand Bibi Sultana. This wedding took place between the two kingdoms: Adil Shahi and Nizam Shahi  

The Makhbara (Shrines) of Nawab Amir Nawazul Mulk Bahadur and beside him Princess Fakharunnisa Begam, daughter of Nizam ul Mulk II Mazars are at Naldrug. Not only the people of Naldrug but the entire Marathawada people visit the shrine to pay respect to their late ruler. After the death of Nawab Sahab his successors became the Governors until 1948. The present successor, seventh in line, is Nawab Mohammed Iqbal Ali Khan Bahadur (Nawab of Balaghat,Asaf Jahi). Still the property of Nawab Sahab is there, and he and his sons frequently make the tour to Naldurg as they have sentimental affection for the soil and people.

'''Mangalgad''', also known as '''Kangori''', is a fort in [[Maharashtra]] near the village of [[Dudhanewadi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Kola'ba and Janjira|publisher=Govt.

The fort is built on the top of a steep and treeless spur of the [[Sahyadris]], 2457 feet high, and is reached by a narrow and rugged path about two miles long. The fort is 1485 feet from east to west and 264 from north to south.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt; 

Mangalgad was built by Chandrarao More of [[Jawli]]. It was one of seven forts captured by Shivaji in 1648.1 It was the place of confinement of Chitursing the brother of the Raja of Satara, from 1812 till his death in 1818. In 1817 Cornets Hunter and Morrison, two English officers on the Madras establishment, on their way from Hyderabad to Poona with a small escort were caught at Uruli twenty miles east of Poona, and imprisoned here. Some time after, by Gokhla's orders, they were removed to [[Vasota]] in [[Satara]], and, on the destruction of that fort in April 1817, they were restored to freedom. In 1818 Kangori was taken by Colonel Prother, after the fall of [[Raigad fort]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

The buildings and the gateway are in ruins but a part of the rampart remains. Within the rampart is a ruined temple and a rock-cut cistern, but no building of any size or interest. Mangalgad consists of a single temple, called [[Kangori Devi]] Temple, with [[cisterns]] at the top. The [[Wada (house)|wada]] and prison are both in ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

'''Lohagad''' (literally &quot;Iron fort&quot; in Marathi) is one of the many [[hill fort]]s of [[Chatrapati Shivaji]].
 
== Geography ==

It is situated 52km from [[Pune]] in western [[India]]. Lohagad is at an [[elevation]] of 3,450 feet (1,052 m). It divides the basins of the Indrayani and Pavna and is situated on a side range of the [[Sahyadris]]. The [[Visapur fort]] is located on its eastern side. The four large gates of Lohagad are still in good condition and reasonably intact. Historical records show that in the later [[Peshwa]] period, [[Nana Phadnavis]] (1742-1800 AD) built several structures in the fort such as a big tank and a step-well ([[bawali]]). 

On the west side, there is a long and narrow wall-like fortified spur called Vinchukata ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] for Scorpion's tail; ''see picture'') because of its shape. Lohagad has a long history with several dynasties occupying it at different periods of time: [[Satavahanas]], [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadavas]], [[Bahamani]]s, [[Nizamshahis]], [[Mughals]] and [[Marathas]]. [[Shivaji]] captured it in 1648 CE, but he was forced to surrender it to the [[Mughals]] in 1665 CE by the [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]]. Shivaji recaptured the fort in 1670 CE and used it for keeping his treasury.  This fort was used to keep the loot from Surat.  Later in Peshwa time Nana Phadanwis used this fort for living for sometime. The fort has been declared as a protected moument by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise|url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to reach the fort==

From [[Mumbai]], you can take a [[train]] to [[Lonavla]]. [[Malavli]] is the next station from [[Lonavla]] in the direction towards Pune. There are a number of local trains operating between [[Lonavla]] and [[Pune]]; you can take any of them. From [[Pune]], you can take any of these locals.

From [[Malavli]] railway station, the fort is just 9&amp;nbsp;km away. Vehicles can go up to the foot of the hill. From here, which is near a village called [[Lohagadwadi]], there are steps to the fort, numbering approximately 500.

However, people can also walk all the way till the fort. [[Bhaja Caves]] is on the way to Lohagad if a small diversion is taken. This walk is a particular favorite of trekkers, especially in the monsoon. It is a simple and easy trek and the distance from [[Malavli]] station to Bhaje gaav takes about 20 min. Distance between Malavli and Lohagadwadi can be covered in around 2-2.5 hrs. The trekking route becomes mucky when it rains and trekkers will have difficulty to walk till the fort. The walk is very enjoyable especially the picturesque scenery, lush green grass, cool mountain air, and the pleasant salubrious climate.  A variety of birds and insects can also be spotted in these hills. 
There is a way to reach by Road.
There are two different routes to reach the base of Lohgad by car.

History to be provided

For people traveling from Mumbai or staying back in PCMC, the route is via Lonavala. 
If starting from Pune take old Mumbai Pune highway. 
Just after you cross toll plaza before lonavala, keep your left till you cross â€œManshaktiâ€ 
There is a Y type left turn just after â€œManshaktiâ€ 
Take that left and drive for another 200 odd meter to take very first left again 
You are on way to lohgad after crossing the place called â€œBhangarwadiâ€ from where it is just 8â€“10&amp;nbsp;km.  If you come across a railway crossing and Mumbai-Pune highway twice you are on right track. 
You are on way to Paud, continue till you reach â€œDudhiware Khindâ€ 
Just before it, take left for Lohgad from here it is around 4&amp;nbsp;km max. 
The road ahead is very steep with couple of sharp turns but safe. 
 

For people traveling from Pune city, the route is via Chandani chowk â€“ Pirangut - Paud 
After reaching Paud take right and drive for around 40 odd km.
Just after you cross â€œDudhiware Khindâ€ you reach to the same place 
Take right for Lohgad base. 
 

It is tar road and you can reach comfortably till the â€œPaythaâ€. Have a safe drive. Itâ€™s a wonderful place and should be tried in between mid August to mid Sept. when you can still have rain but the intensity comes down.

When it rains, the top of the fort is covered with mist and clouds and becomes particularly wet. It is advisable to carry protective gear during the rainy season (mid-June to mid-September). Further, food is not easily available on the route. Most of the food stalls sell water, ''poha'', tea/coffee, snacks, and soft drinks.

A panoramic view of the Pawna dam can be seen from the fort.

'''Rajgad''' (literally meaning ''Royal Fort''), one of the forts of [[Maharashtra]] state in [[India]]. Situated in the [[Pune]] district, the fort is 1318 meters above sea level.

Formerly known as Murumdev, it was capital of the [[Maratha Empire]] (Hindavi Swarajya) ruled by [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] for almost 26 years, after which he moved to [[Raigad fort]] and made that his capital.

Treasure found on adjacent [[Torana Fort]] was used to fortify this hill.

==Location==
The fort is 42&amp;nbsp;km to the south west of Pune, about 15â€“16&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Nasrapur]], in the [[Sahyadris]] range.

This is the highest part of the fort which has remains of palaces, water cisterns and caves. It has an entrance door called Mahadarwaja. One can view the whole fort and the vast surrounding expanse.

This fort is built on the hill called &quot;Murumba Devicha Dongar&quot;
Rajgad boasts the highest number of days stayed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on any fort.

This fort has witnessed lots of historic events, including the birth of [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]], the death of Shivaji's Queen [[Maharani Saibai|Saibai]], the return of Shivaji from Agra, the [[antyayatra]] of [[Tanaji Malusare]] to his Konkan village, the burial of [[Afzal Khan (general)|Afzal Khan]]'s head in the Mahadarwaja walls of Ballekilla, the strict words of Sonopant Dabir to [[Shivaji]], and the [[Khandoji Khopade]] episode.

This fort was also one of the 12 forts that Shivaji kept when he signed the [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)]] with the Rajput king Jai Singh in 1665 who was leading the Mughal forces. 22 other forts were handed over to the Mughals under this treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.travelomy.com/rajgarh-fort/ | title =Rajgarh Fort History | work= | first=  | last=  |publisher = Travelomy | accessdate = 2012-02- 08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ratangad''' ({{lang-mr|à¤°à¤¤à¤¨à¤—à¤¡}}) is a [[fort]] in [[Ratan Wadi]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], overlooking the locale of [[Bhandardara]], one of the oldest artificial catchment area. The fort is about 2000 years old.

'''Ratangad''' has a natural rock peak with a cavity in it at the top which is called 'Nedhe' or 'Eye of the Needle'.

Ratangad was captured by [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje Bhosle]] and was one of his favorites. The base village Ratanwadi has an Amruteshwar temple which is famous for its carvings. The fort is origin for the river Pravara/Amrutvahini. The [[Bhandardara]] dam(arthar dam) is built on this river.

The main attraction at Ratanwadi is the [[Amruteshwar temple]] dating back to the [[Hemadpant]] Era - roughly from the eighth century.

The base village Ratanwadi is approached by boat from Bhandardara. By boat, it is a 6&amp;nbsp;km journey and further it is a 4&amp;nbsp;km walk till Ratanwadi.

'''Suvarnadurg''' (also spelt ''Severndroog'' in English, a spelling sometimes also used for [[Savandurga]] near Bangalore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=378|title=A geographical, statistical, and historical description of Hindostan, and the adjacent counties, Volume 2|author=Walter Hamilton (M.R.A.S.)|publisher=J. Murray|year= 1820}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fort that is located on a small island in the [[Arabian Sea]], near Harnai in [[Konkan]], along the West Coast of [[India]], in the [[States of India|Indian state]] of [[Maharashtra]]. The fort also includes another land fort (small) called the Kanakadurga at the base of headland of Harnai port on the coast. Building of the fort is credited to [[Sultan]] [[Adilshah]] of [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]]. The forts were captured by [[Shivaji]], founder of the Maratha Empire, in 1660. Subsequently, Shivaji, other [[Peshwas]] and the Angres further fortified the forts for defence purposes.&lt;ref name=forts&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/Default.aspx?strpage=../MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/SuvarnadurgFort.html|title=Suvarnadurg Fort|accessdate=2010-01-13|publisher=Government of Maharashtra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suvana&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache:iwzuJbfKfAAJ:maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/RATNAGIRI/places_Harnai.html+Harnai+-+Maharashtra+Gazetteer&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in||archivedate=January 19, 2010|title=Harnai|accessdate=2010-01-14|publisher=Maharashtra Gazetter Department|url=http://ratnagiri.nic.in/distGazette/Part8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literal meaning of Suvanadurga is &quot;Golden Fort&quot; as it was considered as the pride or the &quot;feather in the golden cap of Marathas&quot;. Built for the Maratha Navy for defence purposes, the fort also had a ship building facility. The basic objective of establishing the fort was to counter enemy attacks, mainly by the colonialists of Europe and also by the local chieftains.&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;

In the past, the land fort and the sea fort were connected by a tunnel, but this is now defunct. The present approach to the sea fort is only by boats from the Harnai port on the headland. It is a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise|url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Geography==
The fort is on an island in the [[Arabian sea]] on the west coast within the jurisdiction of [[Ratnagiri district]], off the Kanakadurga fort and below the headland Harnai port. The nearest town is [[Dapoli]], a hill station (near [[Chiplun]]), {{convert|17|km|mi}} from Harnai. Kanakadurga, the harbour fort, built originally as a strategic link to the sea fort has a lighthouse. Harnai, near the dilapidated Kanakadurg fort, is an important harbour, which is right on the edge of the land that protrudes into the Arabian Sea. This is a natural harbour known for large fishing and marketing. It is conjectured that the Kanakadurga fort and other land side forts such as [[Bankot|Bankot fort]], Fategad fort and Gova fort were built primarily as look out forts for the security of the Suvarnadurg fort. There is no landing jetty at the Suvarnadurga fort. However, the landing is on the shores of the sandy beach of the rocky island. Another feature of the area is that a narrow channel separates the Gova, Kanakadurg and Fattehgarh forts on the mainland

;Climate
The general climate on the west coast, which is where the Suvarnadurg is located, could be categorised as hot and humid. The temperatures vary from a maximum of {{convert|38|C|F}} in summer to a low of {{convert|24|C|F}} in winter. South West [[Monsoon]] controls the precipitation on the west coast, which lasts from June to September, and rainfall is in the range of {{convert|140|-|170|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;Naravane p.16&quot;&gt;Naravane p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The forts have recorded history linked to the [[Adil Shahi Dynasty]] (1490 to 1686) of the [[Bijapur Sultanate]]. However, linking its history to an earlier era of the [[Satavahana]] (230 BC to 220 AD) is considered a speculation since no proof could be established to this claim. The forts were captured by Chatrapati Shivaji in 1660 by defeating [[Ali Adil Shah II]] (1656â€“1672). [[Kanhoji Angre]] (1667â€“1729), popularly known as â€œSamudratla Shivajiâ€ was the Admiral of the [[Maratha Navy]]; in 1696, Kanhoji's naval fleet was stationed here. However, the fort was formally handed over to Kanhoji in 1713 by Shahu Raja.&lt;ref name=forts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;

[[Kanhoji Angre]] who was also known as Angria was appointed in 1698 as Admiral of the Maratha Naval Fleet by the [[Peshwas]]. He had complete control over the west coast, from [[Bombay]] to Vingural, except for the fort of [[Janjira]], which remained with the Siddis  (for 200 years). Angre was considered to be a mercenary who attacked defenceless towns and also traders. He even attacked the [[East India Company|East Indian Companyâ€™s]] ship in 1702 and refused to release the British captives (six of them). He severed his relations with the Peshwas in 1704 and was called â€œthe Rebel Independent of the Raja Shivajiâ€. In spite of warning by the British that he should not attack or capture British ships, he captured their ships in 1707. He had a free run of the west coast from [[Surat]] to [[Dabol]] and captured all private vessels. When Shivajiâ€™s grandson was imprisoned, Kanhoji got his opportunity to stake his claim for independence. In 1713, he had captured Peshwaâ€™s general Bhairu, which forced the Peshwa general Balaji Rao (Commander-in-Chief of the Maratha forces) to come to an agreement with him. For maintaining &quot;fealty&quot; with the [[Satara]]s (Chatrapati Shivaji's family stronghold), he was granted 26 forts and its dependent villages, which included Suvarnadurg. In subsequent years, these forts became strongholds for piracy. With his new ordered control, Kanhoji held complete control over a coast line stretching over a coast length of {{convert|240|mi|km}} and {{convert|40|mi|km}} width extending from Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) to Vingurla to the south. He later entered into an agreement with the British, which went against him as the British flouted all terms with him. Humiliated by this treatment by the British he decided to attack them. He entered into an alliance with the Raja of Satara, equipped his vessels and manned them by the best crew consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]]. He also employed a [[Jamaica]]n [[pirate]] as his chief gunner. Many European pirate forces had also joined his army after the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713-14 (comprising a series of individual peace treaties among several [[Europe]]an states including [[England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]], among others). With this force, he terrorized the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;&lt;ref name= Saletore&gt;{{Cite book|last= Saletore|first=R.N.|title= Indian Pirates|works=Angres of Geria|pages=99â€“102|accessdate=2010-01-13|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Suvarnadurg+Fort&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Suvarnadurg%20Fort&amp;f=false|publisher= Concept Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanhoji relentlessly carried on his fight against the British and in 1721 joined hands with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]; when 33 British soldiers were killed, 21 wounded and many ammunition and field guns were seized by the Marathas. In 1722, when Kanhoji was to attack the English factory at [[Karwar]], in spite of the British sending their ships 'Victoria' and the 'Revenge' to attack Kanhoji's forces, he was not cowed down; even though his Dutch Commander was killed and his 16 ships were captured. However, he died on 4 June 1729, an unvanquished hero for 31 years against all foreign attacks. It is said that &quot;Had he been in England, like [[Francis Drake|Drake]], he would have been knighted and lionised as a national hero, but in India he died merely as an independent ruler who never permitted any foreign ruler to filch even a part of his precious little dominionâ€.&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Saletore p.108&quot;&gt;Saletore p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

He had two legitimate and two illegitimate sons, and Sambaji his legitimate son was given control of Suvarnadurg. Following the death of one of the brothers in 1734, there were intense fights and acts of piracy continued. In spite of attacks by the British in 1732, Sambaji was back in Suvarnadurg unharmed. However by 1749, Tulaji, the step brother of Sambaji, had become very powerful and his ships sailed unharmed, even much bolder than what his father Kanhoji had achieved. This situation forced the Peshwas to join hands with the British to suppress Tulaji. In 1755, they jointly attacked Tulajiâ€™s stronghold of Suvarnadurg and took control of the fort within 48 hours. Suvarnadurg was then given to the Peshwas that was considered a humiliating surrender by the Peshwas to the British.&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Saletore pp.109, 111&quot;&gt;Saletore pp.109, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to Kanhoji's demise, Tulaji Angre took charge of Suvarnadurg and it became the seat of his power. However, he fell foul of the Peshwas. He was considered arrogant. In the war with Tulaji, Peshwas were supported by the British. The joint siege of the fort lasted from March 25  to 2 April 1755. On 12 April 1755, [[Sir William James, 1st Baronet|Commodore James]] captured the fort and formally handed it over to the Peshwas. However, this support proved detrimental to the Peshwas, as the British extracted, as a reward, control over the Bankot fort but only allowed the Peshwas to have control over the Suvarnadurg. In 1802, Bajirav Peshwa under attack by the [[Holkars]] was trying to take refuge in this fort but had to flee to [[Vasai]] as he was chased to the fort by the Holkars. In 1818, Captain William of the [[British army]] attacked the fort and took full control of it on 4 December 1818. Soon thereafter the other forts also came under British control. The fort was thus under the control of the Peshwas till 1818. The fort has witnessed a scene of â€œtriumph and tragedy, of the display of heroic courage and abject cowardice.â€ &lt;ref name=forts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Naravane p.4&quot;&gt;Naravane p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angrias are also credited with not only strengthening the fort but also establishing the ship building yard at Suvanadurg and creating a large fleet of warships to secure the west coast, the [[Konkan coast]], from attack from the [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonialists. It is also inferred that the small forts (Guva, Kanakadurga, Bankot fort, Fattegad fort and Gova fort) were primarily built by Kanhoji Angre to defend Suvarnadurg from any enemy attack from the land route.&lt;ref name=forts/&gt;

{{double image|right|Suvarnadurg as seen from afar.jpeg|150|Harnai fishing boats.jpg|150|Left: Suvanadurg, a mile away from the mainland. |Right: Harnai Port on the mainland}}
Suvarnadurg fort is located on a rocky island in the Arabian Sea on the west coast. It is spread over an area of {{convert|8|acre|ha}} and is about {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the main land.&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt; As is common in other similar forts, it is encircled by a dry moat. It tapers towards the southern direction from where the Kanakadurga fort is clearly visible. The walls have been mostly cut out of the rock exposures on the island. However, some part of the fort walls are built with large stone blocks of {{convert|10|-|12|ft|m}} square. It has two entrances or gates, known as the 'Mahadarwaja' (big gate) also called the postern wall (above the high tide level) on the east and 'Chor Darwaja' on the west; the former gate faces the land and the latter faces the sea. The fort comes into sight only at very close quarters. The fort can be approached only during the low tide condition when it is also easier to walk in the precincts of the fort. The present entry from the main east gate is blocked by thorny bushes but can be accessed from a narrow entry, locally known as the ''devdis.'' At the main entry, carvings of a [[Hanuman]] carved on the wall and a carved turtle on one of the leading steps are seen. The sea-gate depicts carved figures of a tiger, eagle and elephants. The fort is fortified with many bastions, which also have small built-in rooms. The central part of the fort has two granaries and a decrepit building. From the Chor Darwaja, steps lead to the fort. Locations of old palaces in the fort area are inferred from the large number of foundation plinths seen in the fort area. A stone building in the fort precincts has been identified as an ammunition magazine. Fifteen old guns have also been located in the fort.&lt;ref name=forts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;&lt;ref name = Naravane&gt;{{Cite book|last= Naravane|first= M.

There are several potable water sources (tanks, ponds and wells) in the fort; however, these dry up in the summer months. There is [[step well]], which has plenty of water.&lt;ref name=forts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;

;Kanakadurga fort
Kanakdurga fort (headland fort) projects into the sea, adjoins the Harnai port and is spread over an area of {{convert|0.25|ha|acre}}. It is approached through a flight of steps. This fort is now in ruins, except for a few water tanks, two dilapidated bastions (one at each end), a lighthouse on elevated ground, and also a residence for the caretaker. It was also once a military camp. The fort has nine water ponds with abundant water supply, of which eight are separated by stone walls and the ninth pond is a little away to the west.&lt;ref name=forts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt;

==Visitor information==
[[Mumbai]] is at a distance of {{convert|230|km|mi}} from Harnai. Harnai, located in a rocky bay, has an all-weather road that connects to [[Dapoli]] and [[Khed, Ratnagiri|Khed]]. The road distances to other nearby forts and towns are: Bankot-Anjarle-Harnai: {{convert|23|km|mi}}; Dapoli-Harnai: {{convert|16|km|mi}}; and Anjarle-Harnai: {{convert|7|km|mi}}. The only approach to the fort is by boats, from Harnai. Boats have to be arranged through the local fishermen.
It is a port of call for Coasting steamers and thrives on fishing as a major marketing centre.&lt;ref name=Suvana/&gt; The nearest Railway station on the [[Konkan Railway]] of the [[Indian Railways]] is at [[Khed, Ratnagiri|Khed]]. The nearest airport is at Mumbai.

'''Arnala Fort''' is built on a small island of the port town of [[Arnala]], located around 8 miles north of [[Vasai]], [[Maharastra]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|title=Friends of Forts|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being an island fort, it is also called '''Jaldurg''' or '''Janjire-Arnala'''. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who owned this fort&lt;ref name=&quot;portugal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholberg|first=Henry|title=Fortress Portugal in India|publisher=NorthStar Publications|year=1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oxhuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=arnala&amp;dq=arnala&amp;lr=&amp;ei=OaSHSf2kFY_GlQTKkvC8Bg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; rebuilt and gave it the name '''Ilha das vacas'''.

== History ==
In 1516, a local chieftain in Gujarat, Sultan Mahmud Begda originally constructed the fort on the island, strategically located at the mouth of the [[Vaitarna river]]. In the 1530s, the Portuguese had established their operations in the coastal area headquartered at [[Bassein Fort|Fort Bassein]] and soon gained control of the island. The Portuguese captain of Bassein donated the island to a Portuguese nobleman who tore down the old fort and began construction of a {{convert|700|x|700|ft|m|adj=on}} fort. Though the fort was never completed by the nobleman, it remained under Portuguese control for two centuries, who used it to control shipping and navigation along the northern [[Konkan]] coast.

During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, after a long struggle with the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Maratha Confederacy]] came to dominate present day [[Maharastra]]. In 1737 the then Peshwa [[Baji Rao I]] sent his brother, [[Chimaji Appa]], to take the Bassein Fort from the Portuguese. After winning the [[Battle of Vasai]], his general, [[Shankarji Pant]], persuaded Chimaji to launch an assault on Fort Arnala, for its strategic importance to the Maratha navy in assaulting Portuguese interests. Their first assault, coordinated with a Maratha naval force commanded by Manaji Agre, was routed by a superior Portuguese naval force. A second assault on the fort on March 28, 1737, caught the Portuguese by surprise and forced them to abandon the fort. The victory was commemorated by a plaque installed on the northern wall of the fort and is still visible today. Marathas then rebuilt the fort, constructing three bastions Bahirav, Bhavani and Bava.

The Marathas controlled the fort until 1817 when, during the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War|third British-Maratha war]], despite successfully defending the fort, they were forced to surrender the fort to the British due to their superior naval power. The Arnala and Bassien forts were returned to the Marathas by the British in the treaty of Salabai, but the forts again changed hands under the treaty of Pune. Today the fort is in a state of disrepair.&lt;ref name=&quot;coast&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Naravane|first=A.V.H.|title=The Maritime and Coastal Forts of India|publisher=APH Publishing|year=1998|pages=43â€“44|isbn=81-7024-910-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k59aVCIlFB8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=arnala&amp;lr=&amp;ei=O6OHSfaEA4PKkQTV6t3uBQ&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA43,M1|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Narnala fort.jpg|thumb|300px|Narnala fort, circa 1860]]
'''Narnala''' (Marathi à¤¨à¤°à¤¨à¤¾à¤³à¤¾) also known as &quot;Shahanur Fort&quot; is an [[India]]n hill fortress in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. The name Narnala was given after the Rajput Ruler Narnal Singh or Narnal Swami. The fort was built in 10 A.D. by Gond Kings. In 15th Century Mughals have occupied and rebuild the fort and hence it has been called Shahnoor Fort. Narnala was one of the thirteen [[Sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkar]] of [[Berar Subah]]. Narnala consists of three small forts named Zafarabad fort (or Jafarabad) on the east, Narnala in the centre and Teliagarh on the west.

== Location ==
It is a historical place since the Khilji Dynasty, and it was one of the Sarkar Subah Berar in the medieval period. The fort is known for the great Muslim saint Hazrat Burhanuddin &quot;BAGH SAWAR WALI&quot; and it is said that many white tigers were seen with the hazrat at that time. ADLI BEG or ATALU BEG erected many Arabic Scripts and the &quot;TUP&quot; named &quot;KADAK BIJLI&quot;. It is also the birthplace of Aurangzeb's great grand son. Sardar Beg Mirza and Qader Beg Mirza were the hereditary descendant of Mughal Dynasty in the 18th century.They to stay near [[Argaon]] 9&amp;nbsp;km away from Hiwarkhed because Shah Beg Subedar of Berar was holding the fort.      
It is located in the [[Akot]] Taluka, [[Akola district|Akola]] District, Berar (also called [[Amravati Division]])at coordinates of 21o 15' N and 77o 4' E. The closest city is [[Akot]] which is 18&amp;nbsp;km away. It is at the southern most tip of the [[Satpura Hills]] at an elevation of 3161 feet(912 m) above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm | Friends of Forts website&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this area falls within the [[Melghat Tiger Reserve]].

== History ==
&lt;!-- Commented out non-English

The Narnala fort / Shahnoor fort built by the Sultan Mahmoud Gazhnavi because he is a follower of Bagh-sawar wali Hazrat Burhanuddin the maintain after Imad shahi dynesty and after this Akbar invaded Berar maintained by Mughals. Mughals recreated the Narnala Fort with Mughal architecture and built mosque at the fort.By his killedar, Shah Dulha Rehman Ghazi of Ellichpur (now Achalpur) was maternal cusion of sultan Mehmoud Ghaznavi and maternal grand son of sultan Nasiruddin Alaptagueen he was marched for battle against rajah Eil.Through the route of Shahnoor fort he was stay here threefold night and pray     
Ahmad Shah Bahamani got the fort repaired around 1425 when he constructed [[Gavilgad]] with a view to obstructing the invaders from the north frontier of his kingdom. Nearly all the present buildings seem to be of Muhammedan origin. The fort passed on to Fatehulla Imad-ul-mulk when he became an independent ruler by 1490 as he was the Subhedar of Berar under the Bahamanis. Gavilgad also passed on to him. Burhan Imad Shah was imprisoned on this fort by one of his Amirs Tufalkhan who crowned himself. In the battle that was fought between Tufalkhan and Murtaza Nizam Shah in 1572 Tufalkhan was defeated and had to flee and took asylum with Muhammad Shah of Khandesh. On being threatened by Murtaza Nizam Shah of dire consequences if the asylum was continued, Muhammad Shah of Khandesh, refused to give refuge to Tufalkhan who was forced to return to Narnala fort and stay there. The fort was invested by the army of Murtaza. The fort surrendered and Tufalkhan and also Burhan Imad Shah were imprisoned along with 40 others. They were confined in the fort of Lohagad where they died while in captivity. Some historians say that all of them were poisoned under the orders of Murtaza Nizam Shah. After the battle that was fought between the armies of the Ahmadnagar kingdom and the Emperor Akbar on January 26, 1597 in which the armies of the Adilshahi Emperor who along with the Kutub Shah of Golconda was an ally of Nizamshah emerged successful. The fort can now ho ascended by a motorable road. About halfway up it crosses first one and then another piece of level ground, each thickly sprinkled with Muhammedan tombs.

The path passes two other strong gateways and one slighter one before entering the heart of the fort, and climbs meanwhile to the uppermost glials. Between the last two gateways are the domed tombs of Bagh Savar Wali and Gaz Badshah. Wali, the former not only rode a tiger in his life but the old Gazetteer slates &quot;even now a tiny white tiger may be seen at night going to and from his tomb.&quot; Passing the last gateway one comes almost at once before the Ambar Bangala, the kacheri of former days

The exact date of construction is not known. The first fortifications, according to local legend, were made by [[Naryendrapun]], a descendant of the [[Pandavas]] and at the time Emperor of [[Hastinapur]] (Delhi). It likely predates 1400 CE as [[Firishta]] -the Persian historian- records that Ninth Badshaha Shahbudeen [[Ahmad Shah I Wali]] (1422 CE to 1436 CE) during construction of the [[Gawilgarh]] fort, made repairs to Narnala fort when he camped at [[Achalpur]] (Elichpur) from 1425 to 1428. This would mean that the Narnala fort was constructed before [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V18_385.gif Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 18, page 379 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1437, when [[Faruqi_dynasty#Nasir_Khan|Nashir Khan]] the subhedar of [[Khandesh]] invaded [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]], the governor of the province (also called Khan-i-Jahan), remained loyal to his master, Ala-ud-din Ahmad Shah II (son of Ahmad Shah I Wali) and retreated to Narnala. He was besieged by disaffected nobles and Nashir Khan, but managed to break through the besieging force with help of Khalaf Hasan Basri who was sent by Ala-ud-din Ahmed Shah II. Nasir Khan was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=VSdWELuOikMC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nasir+khan+narnala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DUUbPr5m3z&amp;sig=enD-wygrJJdyejCiUayLfFlyY18&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA157,M1 | Historic Landmarks of the Deccan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1487 CE Narnala along with [[Gawilgarh]] came under the control of Fateh-ullah [[Imad-ul-Mulk]], the founder of [[Imad shahi dynasty]] at Ellichpur (or Achalpur).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/AKOLA/places_Narnala.html | Maharashtra State Government Gazetteer&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1572 [[Burhan Imad Shah]] (also of the Imad Shahi dynasty) was confined in Narnala by his minister [[Tufal Khan]]. This gave [[Murtaza Nizam Shah]] of Ahmadnagar a pretext to lay siege to the fortress. He captured both king and minister, subsequently putting them to death. Thus the fort passed into the hands of the Ahmednagar kings. In 1597-8, the fort was captured by Akbar's officers, Saiyid Yusuf Khan Mashhad and Shaikh Abul Fazl, from the officer who held it for the Sultan of Ahmadnagar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/Default.aspx?strpage=../MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/NarnalaAkola_AchalpurForts.html | Maharashtra state tourism site&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Akbar]]â€™s rule, Narnala was one of the Sarkars of Berar Subah (see [[Berar_Subah#The_administration_and_the_revenue|Berar Subah]]). Narnala was captured by [[Parsoji Bhosale]] in 1701 CE and remained with the [[Marathas]] till it was taken over by the British in 1803 CE.

== Major Features ==

The fort covers an area of {{convert|362|acre|km2}}. It has 360 watchtowers, six large and twenty one small gates. The large gates are called the Delhi darvaza, the Sirpur darvaza, the Akot darvaza, and the Shahanur darvaza. The innermost of the three gate-ways is the Shahnur or Mahakali gate. It is built of white sandstone and is highly ornate. It is decorated with conventional lotus flowers, a rich cornice, and Arabic inscriptions, and flanked by projecting balconies with panels of stone lattice-work displaying considerable variety of design. It is considered an example of Sultanate style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/08/17/stories/2007081750952200.htm | Hindu online article&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription records the fact that the gate was built in the reign of Shahab-ud-din Mahmud Shah (Bahmani) by Fataullah [[Imad-ul-Mulk]] in 1486. A short verse from the Quran is also inscribed. The fort still display &quot; Ashtakamal&quot; eight petals Lotus which was the symbol of Narnal Singh's dynasty. These lotuses are visible on the mosques and many other places. Hence it is evident that Islamic rulers made changes in Narnal Singh's original architectural construction and converted the place in Moghul form. It was impossible for any ruler to rebuild entire fort considering the geographical location of the fort. 

It has an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] and drains to catch rainwater. Along with 19 tanks, four of which are full throughout the year, this ensured a plentiful water supply to the fort residents.

'''Gawilghur''' (also '''Gawilgarh''' or '''Gawilgad''') was a well-fortified mountain stronghold of the [[Maratha Empire]] north of the [[Deccan]] Plateau, in the vicinity of [[Melghat Tiger Reserve]], [[Amravati District]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|title=Friends of forts|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maharashtra. It was [[Capture of Gawilghur|successfully assaulted]] by an Anglo-Indian force commanded by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] on the 15 December 1803 during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]]. In popular culture, the campaign to take Gawilghur forms the background of the novel ''[[Sharpe's Fortress]]'' by [[Bernard Cornwell]], the third in a trilogy of books covering the eponymous hero's time in the British army in India during the [[Napoleonic era]].

== History ==

The fort takes its name from the [[Gawli]] (cow herds) who inhabited the Berar (modern day Amravati) for centuries. Earlier the fort was likely just made of mud as were several such areas in the region. The exact date of construction is not known but the Persian historian, [[Firishta]], records that Ahmed Shah Wali, the ninth king of the Muzaffarid dynasty built Gawilgarh when he was encamped at Ellichpur in 1425.&lt;ref name=&quot;landmark&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haig|first=Wolseley|title=Historic Landmarks of the Deccan|publisher=Pioneer Press|year=1907|pages=146â€“160|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VSdWELuOikMC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=gawilgarh&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA156,M1|accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likely this was the date when major fortification was carried out. 

In 1803 during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War|2nd Maratha War]] the fort was besieged by Arthur Wellesley (later [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]). After two failed attempts at the main gate by British and Sepoy companies, and many casualties, Captain Campbell led the 94th Scottish Brigade (light company) up the ravine dividing the inner and outer forts and into the inner fort by escalade.  The Scots then forced the northern gatehouse and opened the many gates, allowing the remaining British forces entry.  The British suffered few casualties in the final assault (approx. 150).  The fortress was  returned to the Marathas after making peace with the British but they abandoned it.

== Major features ==

The fort has several inscriptions in Persian recording the date of building of each of its seven gates. It has two water tanks (''Devtalav'' and ''Khantalav''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/AMRAVATI/places_Gavilgad.html|title=Amravati District Gazetteer|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have been the main water source in case the fort was besieged. Within the fort the ruins of a mosque are the most conspicuous. It stands at the highest point in the inner fort and is built in the Pathan style of architecture. The mosque has a square canopy with intricate stone lattice work and a seven arched faÃ§ade. The mosque originally had two minarets, only one of which is intact today.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtdc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/Default.aspx?strpage=../MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/GavilgarhFort.html|title=Maharashtra Government Tourism |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gafur Ahmed, a jaglia (tenant) of the [[Narnala]] fort, tried to determine whether the chambers built into the fort of [[Narnala]] had any use by driving 20 sheep into them. One of the sheep turned up at Gawilgarh which is more than 20 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akola.nic.in/Gazetteers/maharashtra/places_Narnala.html|title=Akola District Gazetteer|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, probably there is an underground tunnel connecting the two forts. 

There are several unrepaired breaches made by British guns, which remain to this day. The gun that killed five attackers with a single shot still stands, although now with graffiti running the length of the barrel.

'''Vasota Fort''' (also called '''Vyaghragad''') is located in [[Satara district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Gazetteers Department - SATARA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/SATARA/places_Vasota.html |title=The Gazetteers Department â€“ SATARA |work= |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was famously defended by [[Tai Telin]] a mistress of [[Pant Pratinidhi]] a killedar of the fort when he was captured. 
Vasota fort is attributed to the Kolhapur Shilahara Raja Bhoja II (1178â€“1193) of Panhala. Vasota always remained with Marathas, Shirkes &amp; Mores in 16th century &amp; then incorporated in Swarajya by Shivaji Maharaj in 1655 during the conquest of [[Javli]]. Shivaji Maharaj named the fort &quot;Vyaghragad&quot; (Vyaghra â€“ means tiger), owing to its difficult natural defense. After Shivaji Maharaj, the brave Maratha Bajirao Peshwa carried on the Swarajya mission of ousting the Mughal invaders from our country. In 1818 however, British bombarded the fort with heavy artillery thereby destroying many buildings on Vasota (Chandika mandir, Daru-kothar, etc.) &amp; looted property worth 5 lakhs.  Today the fort stands in a dilapidated condition in a thick jungle with remnants of Shree Mahadev mandir, the plinth of a huge &quot;sadar&quot; (discussion place), the fallen ramparts  &amp; spectacular view of Nageshwar peak &amp; Shivsagar lake (Koyna backwaters). 
It is located about 350&amp;nbsp;km from Mumbai, it is a protected natural reserve and a national treasure nest. The blue-green expanse of Koyna backwaters, the evergreen forests of Koyna wildlife sanctuary, hike to Vasota fort hidden in thick jungle, the spectacular view from top of the fort along with the beauty and serenity of the place leaves one spell bound.

[[Image:Pune ShaniwarWada DelhiGate.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Present day Shaniwar Wada]]
'''Shaniwarwada''' ({{audio|Ma-Shaniwarwada.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[palace]] [[fort]] in the city of [[Pune]] in Maharashtra, India. Built in 1746,&lt;ref name=&quot;gajrani&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last= Gajrani |first=S. |title=History, Religion and Culture of India |volume=III |year=2004 |page=255 |isbn=978-81-8205-062-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the seat of the ''[[Peshwa]]'' rulers of the [[Maratha Empire]] until 1818 when the ''Peshwas'' surrendered to the British. The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.

Following the rise of the [[Maratha Empire]], the palace became the centre of Indian politics in 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_shaniwarwada-was-centre-of-indian-politics-ninad-bedekar_1618983 |title=Shaniwarwada was centre of Indian politics: Ninad Bedekar |place=Mumbai |work=Daily News and Analysis |location=India |date=November 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[Image:Shaniwarwada gate.JPG|thumb|right|Front gate of Shaniwarwada]]
Peshwa [[Baji Rao I]], prime minister to [[Chattrapati Shahu]], king of the Maratha empire, laid the ceremonial foundation of his own residence on Saturday, January 10, 1730. It was named ''Shaniwarwada'' from the Marathi words ''Shaniwar'' (Saturday) and ''Wada'' (a general term for any residence complex). [[Teak]] was imported from the jungles of [[Junnar]], stone was brought from the nearby quarries of [[Chinchwad]], and [[Lime (mineral)]] was brought from the lime-belts of [[Jejuri]]. Shaniwarwada was completed in 1732, at a total cost of Rs. 16,110, a very large sum at the time.

The opening ceremony was performed according to [[Hindu]] religious customs, on January 22, 1732, another Saturday chosen for being a particularly auspicious day.

Later the Peshwas made several additions, including the fortification walls, with bastions and gates; court halls and other buildings; fountains and reservoirs. Currently, the perimeter fortification wall has five gateways and nine bastion towers, enclosing a garden complex with the foundations of the original buildings.
It is situated near the [[Mula-Mutha River]], in [[Kasba Peth]].

Despite its cultural value the fort is not maintained well by the Government. Its inability to maintain the historical Shaniwarwada from the funds provided by central archaeology department forced the fortâ€™s advisory committeeâ€™ to woo business houses to fund Shaniwarwadaâ€™s makeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ajay Khape |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/shaniwarwada-upkeep-gaze-is-on-biz-houses/266712/ |title=Shaniwarwada upkeep: Gaze is on biz houses |publisher=Express India |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort complex==

===Gates===
[[Image:Shaniwarwada 1860.jpg|thumb|right|The imposing walls of the Shaniwar Wada, in a 1860 photograph]]
Shaniwarwada has five gates:
* ''Dilli Darwaza'' (Delhi Gate), facing north
:The ''Dilli Darwaza'' is the main gate of the complex, and faces north towards [[Delhi]]. [[Chhatrapati Shahu]] is said to have considered the north-facing fort a sign of Baji Rao's ambitions against the [[Mughal empire]], and suggested that the main gate should be made ''chhaatiiche, maatiche naahi!'' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] for of the chests of brave soldiers, not mere mud).

:The strongly built ''Dilli Darwaza'' gatehouse has massive doors, large enough to admit elephants outfitted with [[howdah]]s (seating canopies). To discourage elephants charging the gates, each pane of the gate has seventy-two sharp twelve-inch steel spikes arranged in a nine by eight grid, at approximately the height of the forehead of a battle-elephant. Each pane was also fortified with steel cross members, and borders were bolted with steel bolts having sharpened cone heads. The bastions flanking the gatehouse has arrow-loops and [[machicolation]] chutes through which [[Early thermal weapons|hot substances]] could be poured onto offending raiders. The right pane has a small man-sized door for usual entries and exits, too small to allow an army to enter rapidly. Shaniwar Wada was built by contractor from Rajasthan known as 'Kumawat Kshatriya', after completing construction these people well known by name 'Naik'. The name 'Naik' was given to them by Peshwa.  

:Even if the main gates were to be forced open, a charging army would need to turn sharply right, then sharply left, to pass through the gateway and into the central complex. This would provide a defending army with another chance to attack the incoming army, and to launch a counterattack to recapture the gateway.

:As the ceremonial gate of the fort, military campaigns would set out from and be received back here, with appropriate religious ceremonies.

* ''Mastani Darwaja'' (Mastani's Gate) or ''Alibahadur Darwaja'', facing north
:This gate was used by Bajirao's mistress [[Mastani]] while travelling out of the palace's perimeter wall.

*''Khidki Darwaja'' (Window Gate), facing east
:The ''Khidki Darwaja'' is named for an armoured window it contains.

*''Ganesh Darwaja'' ([[Ganesh]] Gate), facing south-east
:Named for the [[Ganesh Rang Mahal]], which used to stand near this door. It could be used by ladies at the fort to visit the nearby [[Kasba Ganapati]] temple.

*''Jambhul Darwaja'' or ''Narayan Darwaja'' (Narayan's Gate), facing south
:This gate was used by concubines to enter and leave the fort. It obtained its second name after [[Narayanrao Peshwa]]'s corpse was removed from the fort for cremation through this gate.

===Palaces===
The important buildings in the palace includes the ''Thorlya Rayancha Diwankhana'' (Marathi:The court reception hall of the eldest royal, meaning Baji Rao I), ''Naachacha Diwankhana'' (Dance Hall), and ''Juna Arsa Mahal'' (Old Mirror Hall).

Since the buildings were destroyed in the fire of 1828, only descriptions of the living areas of the fort are available. All the state halls in the buildings are said to have doorways with exquisitely carved teak arches, with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like ''Suru'' ([[Cupressaceae|cypress]] tree) trunks supporting the ceilings, which were covered with beautiful teak tracery, carved creepers and flowers. Exquisite glass chandeliers hung from the ceilings. The floors were made of highly polished [[marble]], arranged in a [[mosaic]] pattern and adorned with rich [[Persian rug]]s. The walls contained paintings with scenes from the [[Hindu epic]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]].

The buildings are said to have been designed and constructed by many well-known artisans, including [[Shivaram Krishna]], [[Devaji Sutar|Devaji]], [[Kondaji Sutar]], [[Morarji Patharwat Bhojraja]] (an inlay-work expert from [[Jaipur]]) and [[Ragho]] (a painter).

One of the buildings in the Shaniwarwada complex was seven storeys high. It is said that the spire of the [[Sant Dnyaneshwar]] temple at [[Alandi]], 17&amp;nbsp;km away, could be seen from the uppermost terrace of this building.

===The Fountain===
The complex had an impressive [[lotus (plant)|lotus]]-shaped fountain: the ''Hazari Karanje'' (Fountain of a thousand jets). It was constructed for the pleasure of the infant [[Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao]]. It was designed as a sixteen petal lotus; each petal had sixteen jets with an eighty foot arch. It was the most complicated and intricate fountain of its time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Captain More who visited the Shaniwarwada in 1791 described it as â€œvery magnificent. A hundred dancers can dance here at a time. In one corner is a marble [[Ganapati]] statue and the palace is flanked by a fountain and a flower garden.â€.

==History==
[[Image:ShaniwaarWada 4.JPG|thumb|right|Interiors of Shaniwarwada]]

By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort. 

In June 1818, the [[Peshwa]], [[Bajirao II]], abdicated his ''Gaadi'' (throne) to Sir [[John Malcolm]] of the [[British East India Company]] and went into political exile at [[Bithoor]], near [[Kanpur]] in present-day [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.

On February 27, 1828, a great fire started inside the palace complex. The conflagration raged for seven days. Only the heavy granite ramparts, strong teak gateways and deep foundations and ruins of the buildings within the fort survived.

[[Image:Kotligad fort.jpg|thumb|175px|The distinctive chimney-like feature of Kotligad fort]] 

'''Kothaligad''' (also called Kotligad or Kothligad) is a small [[Fort]] (1500ft.) is situated to the east of [[Karjat]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]]. It is one of the famous treks in the Karjat area, because of its small height and easy climbing. It is also known as the ''Fort of Peth'' because of its vicinity to Peth village at its base.

There is a small [[temple]] and large [[cave]] at the base and a chimney like tunnel (see image) to the top of the fort. This pinnacle is carved from inside forming a staircase reaching the top.

There is a tank of water at some distance from the cave and another one at the top of the fort. This tunnel is the high point of the trek, with its funnel like structure and steps along the inside in a steep ascent to the very top.

==History==

The cave and the temple carvings date back to the 13th century. Not much is known about the history until the 18th cent. In 1716, this cave was captured by the British. Then later on, on November 2, 1817, it was recaptured by the Marathas under the leadership of Bapurao who belonged to the generation after Bajirao. It was recaptured by the British, on December 30, 1817, the very next month, under Captain Brooks. The British had the fort till 1862 as an outpost for vigilance on the surrounding valley and the hills all around it.

The locals when spoken to tell that this is not actually a fort but a sort of light house from where the directions were given to know the advancements of the enemy. in fact it can be called a watch tower to keep a vigil on the mawal area in the greater province of the Marathas. Its absolutely breath taking to climb and to have a feeling of the engineering marvel being crafted when there were no engineers like today or even no PWD departments as well. only the foresightedness of the Maratha warrior has been behind the development of the watch tower standing atop the small but sturdy hillock. the stone is a single black expanse reaching till the Peth village standing on the fertile soil with abundant natural resources for water and farming.

'''Vishalgad''' (also called Khelna or Khilna) was one of the important forts of [[Shivaji]] and [[Maratha Empire]].  The name â€˜Vishalgadâ€™ meaning ''grand fort'' in Marathi, was given by [[Shivaji]] after annexing it for the [[Maratha Empire]] in 1659.The fort is about 1130 metres that is 3630 feet.

==Origin of the name ''Vishalgad''==
Khelna was in the control of [[Adilshah]] of [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]]. [[Shivaji]] wanted to conquer the fort but the terrain of the fort was difficult; conquering the fort was easier said than done. Shivaji attacked the fort but the Adilshahi garrison at the fort was defending the fort valiantly. Then, Shivaji came up with a plan. Accordingly, a group of Marathas went up to the fort and convinced the Adilshahi commander (killedar) of the fort that they were not content with the rule of Shivaji and thus, had come to serve the Adilshah. The Marathas were successful and the next day, they revolted and caused total chaos inside the fort. Simultaneously, Shivaji attacked the fort from outside and in no time captured the fort. Shivaji renamed the fort as Vishalgad.

The fort is situated in [[Maharashtra]], [[India.]] It is 76 km North-West of [[Kolhapur]], 60 km north-west of [[Panhala fort]] and 18 kilometers south of [[Kolhapur]] [[Ratnagiri]] road. It is situated on the hills that divide the region into two parts viz [[Amba Ghat]] and ''Anaskura'' ghat. 
Since it is placed on the border of the hilly portion of [[Sahyadri]] ranges and the [[konkan]] region, it got great political significance in the historical times. It was regarded as a '[[Watch tower]]' for both  regions.

==Site Seeing==
The fort has following sites nearly in ruins today except the ''Dargah''.
*Amruteshwar Temple
*Shri Nrusinha Temple
*Takmak Tok
*Satiâ€™s Vrindavan
*The ''Dargah'' or tomb of Hazrat Malik Raihan. Thousands of Devotees visit the ''Dargah'' every year.
*Samadhis built in the memory of Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Phulaji Prabhu Deshpande, who laid down their lives to protect Chhatrapati Shivaji from the clutches of Siddhi Johar while escaping from fort Panhala to Vishalgad.

==History==
*The fort was constructed by the [[Shilahara]] king â€˜Marsinhâ€™ in 1058 A.C. Initially, he named it as 'Khilgil'
*In 1209, the then king of [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] defeated [[Shilahara]]s and captured the fort
*In 1309, [[Allauddin Khilji]] defeated King Ramchandra of the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] and soon the fort was attached to the [[Khilji Dynasty]]
*In August 1347, the Mughal chief of the western India [[Hasan Gangu]] [[Bahamani]] became independent as a result of which the fort became a part of [[Bahamani]] Sultanat
*During 1354 to 1433, the fort was under the rule of [[Vijayanagar Empire]]
*After the fall of the [[Vijayanagar Empire]], it was captured by a local Maratha king Shankarrao More. Therefore, the [[Bahamani]] Sultan sent troops from [[Bidar]] under the Generalship of Mahmood Gawan, his then prime Minister, to re-capture it. Gawan's officers Karnasinh Bhonsale and his son Bhimsinha captured the fort with the help of ''Ghorpad'' i.e. Giant [[monitor lizard]]. Thenceforth, Bhimsinha was conferred with the title ''Ghorpade''.
*In 1489, [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] separated himself from the [[Bahamani]] kingdom along with the area under his command and founded his independent sultanat at [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]]. Hence, the fort was attached to [[Adil Shahi]] sultanate.
*In 1659, [[Shivaji]] captured the fort with the help of the officers on the fort.
*In July 1660, the fort witnessed [[Shivaji]]'s escape from the [[Adilshahi]] blockade around fort [[Panhala]] and the [[Battle of Pavan Khind]].  [[Baji Prabhu Deshpande]], [[Shivaji]]'s experienced General and [[Rango Narayan Orpe]], [[Shivaji]]'s young officer on the fort, defeated [[Adilshahi]] troops at Pavan Khind and Gonimooth respectively.
*After [[Shivaji]]'s death, Chhatrapati [[Sambhaji]] would spend most of his times on the fort. He took initiative in renovation and reconstruction of some parts of the fortresses and gates of the fort.
*In 1689, [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] fled to Fort [[Gingee]] in Karnataka (now Tamil Nadu) from fort [[Panhala]] and thus â€˜Vishalgadâ€™ became an un-official capital of the [[Maratha empire]]. [[Ramchandra Pant Amatya]] from Vishalgad and [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] from [[Gingee]] made several  moves and defeated [[Aurangzeb]] with the help of Santaji, Dhanaji, Parshurampant Pratinidhi and Shankaraji Narayan Sacheev.
*During the times of [[Maratha Empire]], Vishalgad was made [[capital (political)|capital]] of a large region consisting of ninety towns and villages in [[Kolhapur]] and [[Ratnagiri]] districts. Sardesai and [[Sarpotdar]] were officers on the fort since [[Adilshahi]] times. Some of the [[Havaldar]]s (Military In Charge) on the fort during  [[Rajaram Chhatrapati]] to Chhatrapati [[Chattrapati Shahu|Shahu]]'s times were :
*#Trimbakji Ingawale - 3 years
*#Santaji Kathe - 9 years
*#Khandoji Karanjkar - 3 months
*#Umaji Gaikwad - 6 months
*#Shamji Rangnath Orpe [[Sarpotdar]] - 6 years
*#Vithoji Nimbalkar - 6 months
*#Malji Dalvi - 2 months
*In 1844, as a result of mutiny by the ''Killedars'', [[United Kingdom|British]] army demolished the entire fort and dismissed the officers there

'''Lingana''' is a massive pinnacle on the mainline of the Sahyadris between [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] and Torna. It takes its name from its shape which is like a [[linga]]. It is 2969 feet high with an ascent of four miles, the first half is easy to climb while the second is difficult. Its rock cut steps have been destroyed and the fort is almost completely inaccessible. The top of the fortified rock is 2500 feet square. No fortifications or buildings remain but there are traces of a grain store and some cisterns. &lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt Central Press|date=1883|volume=11|pages=343|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w7wMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=lingana+fort&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=lingana%20fort&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lingana fort was built by Shivaji in 1648 to secure central Konkan against the Sidis. Under the Marathas, Lingana was used as a penal settlement. The prisoners were confined to rock dungeons with one dungeon holding 50 prisoners. Lingana was captured by a Colonel Prother in 1818. &lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">'''Manikgad'''(also called Gadchandur) is an ancient fort in [[Chandrapur district]], [[Maharashtra]]. It is a hill fort 507 metres above sea level built by the Naga kings in the 9 CE. &lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|title=Friends of Forts|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;Currently the forts is in a state of ruins and is frequently by wild animals that live in the vicinity like panthers and boars. Several monuments of historical importance are also present in the area. &lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanda.nic.in/htmldocs/pdf/dgazette2/places_Manikgad.html|title=Chandrapur District Gazetteer|publisher=Government of Maharashtra|accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Manikgad was built by the last Mana [[Naga people|Naga]] King - Gahilu. The Mana Nagas settled in this area around 9 CE. Initially, the fort was named Manikagad after the patron deity of the Mana Nagas - Manikadevi - but later on this got shortened to Manikgad.  Local legend holds that the fort was built by a [[Gondi people|Gond]] king named Mankyal(hence the name Manikgad). However, the lintel of the entrance gate has a Naga image carved in relif and not the Gond emblem of lion and an elephant. So this legend is not true.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

== Major features ==
The fort is built of large black stones and it would have been a formidable fort in its time.  Rampart walls of the fort enclose a valley which has ruins of old buildings and store-houses. Outlines of some apartments are visible against the rampart walls.  The southern bastion along with its supporting wall has collapsed. In the valley below lies a cannon which likely was mounted on that bastion. Unlike a cast iron cannon, this cannon made of several iron straps welded together. The gateway of the fort is still intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

'''Mangi-Tungi''' is a prominent twin-pinnacled peak with plateau in between, located near Tahrabad about 125&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nasik]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. Mangi, {{Convert|4343|ft|m|abbr=on}} high above sea level, is the western pinnacle and Tungi, {{Convert|4366|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, the eastern.

==Overview==
There are numerous temples and is considered sacred in [[Jainism]]. It enshrines images of [[Tirthankara]]s in several postures including ''[[Lotus position|Padmasana]]'' and ''kayotsarga''. Sometimes, it is described as ''Siddha Kshetra'', meaning a gateway to the state of enlightenment.

Around 4,500 steps lead to the foot of the peak, which is enriched with several monuments of historical and religious prominence. Besides, there are numerous caves named after great Tirthankaras such as [[Mahavira]], [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Adinath]], [[Shantinath]] and [[Parshva]]. A grand fair is held here annually during ''Kartik'' (September-October) where people visit in large numbers to witness festival.

There are many inscriptions on idols, most of them are not clear due to deterioration with time. Many idol installed in V.S. 651 are here. Many inscriptions on rocks of the Adinath and [[Shantinath]] caves here are in [[Sanskrit]] Language.

==Mangi Giri==
There are seven old temples on this hill and many images of 'charanas' (feets) of saints are installed here. There is pond named Krishna Kund, which is said to be a witness of the last days of Lord Krishna. According to texts, elder brother of lord [[Krishna]], Balram also practiced salvation and achieved fifth heaven. Here is a Cave named Balbhadra Cave where idols of Balram and many others are installed.

==Tungi Giri==
There are five temples on it. There are two caves named on Bhagwan Chandraprabhu, the 8th Tirthankara, and other is Ram Chandra Cave. Ancient idols of Hanuman, Gava, Gavaksha, Neel etc. are here. In one cave there is an idol of Ramâ€™s chief of army Kritantvakra in the stage of ascetic saint.
On the path between Mangi &amp; Tungi Hills, there are two Caves of Shuddha &amp; Buddha Munies (ascetic saints). a Colossus of Bhagwan Munisuvrat Nath is here in [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] posture. Lord Bahubali and otherâ€™s idols are also here.

==Beliefs of Jainism==
[[Rama|Ram]] and [[Hanuman]] attained complete liberation from Mount Mangitungi and are enjoying perfect bliss of the Siddhas. It is learnt from the Nirwankand that Ram, Hanu, Sugriva, Sunil, Gava, Gavaksha, Neel, Mahaneel and ninety-nine crore monks attained complete liberation from Maingitungi, which is a place of worship for Jain followers.

Many idols on both the hills are carved on the rocks. Beautiful and attractive stone carvings  of [[Yaksha]] and [[Yakshini]] (attendants of the Tirthankaras) and [[Indra]] can be seen here.

Mangi-Tungi is also an ideal spot for hiking.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Kattalgad (literally ''death fort'') is a square [[hill fort]] in [[Wai Taluka]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

== Location ==

It is ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] and 32&amp;nbsp;km from [[Satara]]. Its coordinates are 18Â° 05' N, 74Â° 00' E. It has an elevation of {{convert|4511|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name = &quot;satara&quot;&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/SATARA/places_KamalgadFort.html Satara District Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;&gt;[http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm Friends of forts website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The builder of the fort is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;/&gt; During [[Maratha]] times, Kamalgad, [[Pandavgad]] and other forts in the area were administered by a mokasaddar (manager) from [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; Early documents written in now defunct [[Modi script]] of the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language refer to the fort as 'Kattalgad'.&lt;ref name= &quot;blog&quot;/&gt; A detailed study of these documents is underway. In April 1818, Kamalgad surrendered after resistance to a British detachment commanded by a Major Thatcher.&lt;ref name = &quot;satara&quot;/&gt; Under the British, it was used to execute prisoners of war.&lt;ref name =&quot;blog&quot;&gt;[http://sahyadris.blogspot.com/2005/07/pandavgad_112229220274462980.html Description of a Trek to Pandavgad]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major Features ==
[[Image:The path to enlightenment.jpg|thumb|250px|Red ocher in Kamalgad fort]]

The fort covers a flat area, 3-4 acres in size. It is surrounded by steep rock and can only be reached by perilously scaling this rock. Earlier, the approach was by an artificial tunnel, which started at the base of the rock and emerged on the top. Now this tunnel is blocked by a big rock which fell into it and was never removed.&lt;ref name = &quot;bombay&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no buildings on the top nor walls of any kind or even a gateway, which is unusual for a fort in this area. Likely, its height and steep rock around it provided it with enough protection. 

The only structure on the top is a hole which is the remains of a well sunk right through the rock, into the soil below which still has  water. The hole is eighteen to twenty feet deep. The sides of the well which were formed of the natural rock were reported to have contained recesses in which criminals were placed. They had to choose between starvation and drowning.&lt;ref name= &quot;satara&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; However, none of the recesses can be discerned today. Some reports indicate that this 'hole' might have been a quarry for red stone ([[geru]]) which is plentiful in this region&lt;ref name=&quot;trek&quot;/&gt; (''see picture'').

'''Panhala fort''' (also known as '''Panhalgad''', '''Pahalla''' and '''Panalla''' (literally &quot;the home of serpents&quot;), is located in [[Panhala]], 20 kilometres northwest of [[Kolhapur]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is strategically located looking over a pass in the [[Sahyadri]] mountain range which was a major trade route from [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] in the interior of Maharashtra to the coastal areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara&quot;/&gt; Due to its strategic location, it was the centre of several skirmishes in the [[Deccan]] involving the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] and the British [[East India Company]], the most notable being the [[Battle of Pavan Khind]]. Here, the queen regent of Kolhapur, [[Tarabai]], spent her formative years. Several parts of the fort and the structures within are still intact.

[[File:Fine detail Panhala.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Peacock motif on Panhala fort of the Adil Shah Sultanis]]
Panhala fort was built between 1178 and 1209 CE, one of 15 forts (others including Bavda, [[Bhudargad]], Satara, and [[Vishalgad]]) built by the [[Shilahara]] ruler [[Bhoja II]]. A copper plate found in Satara shows that Raja Bhoja held court at Panhala from 1191â€“1192 CE. About 1209â€“10, Bhoja Raja was defeated by Singhana (1209â€“1247), the most powerful of the [[Yadavas of Deogiri|Devgiri Yadavas]], and the fort subsequently passed into the hands of the Yadavas. Apparently it was not well looked after and it passed through several local chiefs. In 1376 inscriptions record the settlement of Nabhapur to the south-east of the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt Central Press|location=Bombay, India|year=1866|pages=314â€“315|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=asAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=norris+panhala&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA314,M1|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an outpost of the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahamanis]] of [[Bidar]]. [[Mahmud Gawan]], an influential prime minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469. On the establishment of the Adil Shahi dynasty of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] in 1489, Panhala came under Bijapur and was fortified extensively. They built the strong ramparts and gateways of the fort which, according to tradition, took a hundred years to build. Numerous inscriptions in the fort refer to the reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah, probably Ibrahim I (1534â€“1557).&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

=== Under Shivaji Maharaj ===

In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general [[Afzul Khan]], in the ensuing confusion [[Shivaji]] took Panhala from Bijapur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulkarni|first=A.R.|title=Marathas and the Marathas Country |publisher=Books and Books|year=1996|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kyBuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=panhala+fort&amp;dq=panhala+fort&amp;ei=T-l4SeToN5WYkwTxsoXIBg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1660, to win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656â€“1672) of Bijapur sent his army under the command of [[Siddi Johar]] to lay siege to Panhala. Shivaji fought back and they could not take the fort. The siege continued for 4 months, at the end of which all provisions in the fort were exhausted and Shivaji was on the verge of being captured.

Under these circumstances, Shivaji decided that escape was the only option. He gathered a small number of soldiers along with his trusted commander [[Baji Prabhu Deshpande]] and, on 13 July 1660,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Indian Institute of Public Administration Maharashtra Regional Branch|title=Shivaji and Swarajya|publisher=Orient Longman|year=1975|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ytQgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=panhala+fort&amp;dq=panhala+fort&amp;lr=&amp;ei=qPp4SYLcMZH6lQT_89C_Bg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; they escaped in the dead of night to flee to Vishalgad. Baji Prabhu and a barber, [[Shiva Kashid]], who looked like Shivaji, kept the enemy engaged, giving them an impression that Shiva Kashid was actually Shivaji.

=== Under the Kolhapur kings ===
[[File:panhala.20.jpg|thumb|upright|Konkan Darwaja - Another entrance to the fort]]
When Shivaji died, Sambhaji was able to convince the garrison at Panhala to join him in overthrowing his stepbrother [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Rajaram]], thus becoming the [[Chhatrapati]](king) of the Maratha Empire. In 1689, when Sambhaji was imprisoned by Aurangzeb's general Takrib Khan at Sangameshwar, the Mughals came to possess the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; However, it was re-captured in 1692 by Kashi Ranganath Sarpotdar under the guidance of Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi a Maratha garrison commander of the fort of [[Vishalgad]]. In 1701 Panhala finally surrendered to Aurangzeb, who came for it in person.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; On 28 April 1692 the Mughal Emperor famously received the English ambassador [[Sir William Norris, 1st Baronet|Sir William Norris]] at Panhala fort. Norris spent &quot;300 pounds in fruitless negotiation&quot; with Aurangzeb but the details of what was being discussed was not disclosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; Within a few months the fort was retaken by the Maratha forces under [[Ramchandra Pant Amatya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt;

In 1693, Aurangzeb attacked it again. This led to another long siege in which Rajaram escaped disguised as a beggar to [[Gingee Fort]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mughal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Agrawal|first=Ashwini |title=Studies in Mughal History|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=1993|pages=167|isbn=81-208-2326-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AZdCrUxFAHEC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=panhala+fort&amp;lr=&amp;ei=evd4SbOELpeOkASQjq2wDw&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA167,M1|accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his 14-year-old wife [[Tarabai]] in Panhala. As Aurangzeb pursued Rajaram, Tarabai would stay at Panhala for almost five years before meeting her husband again. During this formative period of her life, Tarabai looked after the administration of the fort, resolved disputes and gained the respect of the people. The time she spent at Panhala provided her with experience in courtly matters and the support of her officers,&lt;ref name=&quot;tara&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Eaton|first=Richard Maxwell|title=The New Cambridge History of India|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|pages=180â€“194|isbn=0-521-25484-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DNNgdBWoYKoC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=panhala+fort&amp;lr=&amp;ei=q_J4ScfyDonikATOldjRBg&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA181,M1|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would influence later events. Rajaram did send reinforcements from Gingee, and Panhala came into Maratha hands in October 1693.&lt;ref name=&quot;mughal&quot;/&gt;

In 1700, [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Rajaram]], died leaving behind a 12-year-old sonâ€”[[Shivaji II]]â€”by his wife [[Tarabai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulkarni|first=A.R.|coauthors=Nayeem, M.A|title=History of Modern Deccan|publisher=Abul Kalam Azad Oriental Research Institute|year=2000|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IjJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=panhala+fort&amp;dq=panhala+fort&amp;lr=&amp;ei=hvB4SaGFN5OmkQTouqTUBg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1705, [[Tarabai]] asserted her autonomy by founding an independent dynasty in the name of her son Shivaji II and ruling it as regent with Panhala as her headquarters.  In Tarabai's war with [[Shahuji]] of Satara in 1708, Shahu took Panhala and Tarabai fled to [[Malvan]] in Ratnagiri. Shortly after, in 1709, Tarabai again took Panhala, established [[Kolhapur#Kolhapur_as_a_princely_state|a separate state]] (Kolhapur) and made Panhala the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara&quot;/&gt; This it would remain till 1782.

After the death of Tarabai, Sambhaji II, the son of [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Rajaram]] by his second wife Rajasbai succeeded to the throne. He died without issue in 1760. His widow Jijabai &lt;!-- (''not to be confused with [[Jijabai]] - mother of Shivaji'') --&gt; adopted the son of a Sahaji Bhonsle of Kanvat. Thus, Jijabai became the acting regent during the time that her adopted son was a minor. She came to believe that to prevent the fall of Panhala, the Mahakali shrine at the fort had to be ritually offered human blood for the appeasement of Goddess Kali. She would periodically send out her soldiers at night to scour the neighboring villages for victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; This practice would continue until her death in 1772. One of the towers near where these sacrifices occurred is still called the Kali tower. There were reports of Jijabai bestowing a plot of land to an oilman or [[Teli]] in return for the grant of his daughter-in-law to be buried alive under one of the Panhala towers.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; A shrine to the Teli's daughter-in-law (Gangubai) was subsequently erected and it is still a pilgrimage site for the people of the Teli community.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff&quot;/&gt;

In 1782, the seat of the Kolhapur government was moved from Panhala to Kolhapur. In 1827, under [[Shahoji I]] (1821â€“1837), Panhala and its neighboring fort [[Pavangad]] were given over to the [[British Raj]]. In 1844, during the minority of [[Shivaji IV]] (1837â€“1860), Panhala and Pavangad were taken by rebels who seized Colonel Ovans, the Resident of Satara, when he was on tour and imprisoned him in Panhala. A British force under General Delamotte was sent against the rebels and on 1 December 1844 breached the fort wall, took it by storm, and dismantled the fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Divekar|first=V.

The administration of the fort remained with Kolhapur until 1947.

[[File:Panhala walls on Konkan side.jpg|thumb|Panhala fortifications (tatabandi)]]

=== Fortifications and bastions ===
More than 7&amp;nbsp;km of fortifications (''Tatabandi'') define the approximately triangular zone of Panhala fort. The walls are protected for long sections by steep [[escarpments]], reinforced by a parapet with slit holes. The remaining sections have 5â€“9 m (2â€“5&amp;nbsp;ft) high ramparts without a parapet, strengthened by round bastions the most notable of which is Rajdindi. (See later section)

=== Andhar Bavadi ===
Whenever an army besieged a fort, their first action was to poison the main water source of the fort. To counter this, Adil Shah commissioned the building of the Andhar Bavadi (Hidden Well).&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/travel/1998/feb/24kol.htm|title=A Long Weekend in Kolhapur |last=Srinivasam|first=V.|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a three-storey structure&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;/&gt; with winding staircases that conceal the well which was the main water source for Panhala fort. There are recesses in the wall so that soldiers can be permanently stationed. Several hidden escape routes in the Andhar Bavai lead outside the fort. With its own water source, living quarters and its own exit routes, likely this structure was designed like a fort within a fort with the intention of making it an emergency shelter in case the main fort fell.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Kalavanticha Mahal ===

The name of this building, which is also called ''Nayakini Sajja'', literally means &quot;Courtesans' Terrace room&quot;. It stands on the east side of the fort close to the rampart. By 1886, it had become a complete wreck with only traces of ornamental work on the ceiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; This was used during the occupation of the fort by the Bahmani Sultanate as a Rang Mahal&lt;ref name=&quot;ceylon&quot;/&gt;(residences for the ladies of the court&lt;ref name=&quot;rang&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nath|first=R. |title=History of Mughal Architecture|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2006|edition=Illustrated|isbn=81-7017-414-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ah9yDUfWvBcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA357&amp;dq=rang+mahal&amp;client=firefox-a|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

It was built on an island (Morro de Chaul)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indica  |publisher=Saint Xavier's College, Bombay Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture|year=2004|url=http://books.google.com/?id=L_htAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=korlai+fort&amp;dq=korlai+fort|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which guards the way to the Revdanda Creek. It was meant as a companion to the fort at [[Chaul]]. At this strategic position the Portuguese could use it to defend their province which stretched from Korlai to Bassein. Vestiges of the Portuguese occupation are manifested in the distinct dialect of the Korlai villages inhabitants which is a Portuguese Creole called [[Kristi language|Kristi]].

== History ==
This fort was built in 1521 by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] with the permission of the [[Ahmednagar_Sultanate#Ahmadnagar_sultanate|Ahmednagar sultanate]]. In 1521, taking advantage of the confusion in the aftermath of the death of the Burhan Nizam the Portuguese tried to take over the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay &quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt. Central Press|year=1883|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4bMIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=korlai+fort|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the sultan retaliated and sent some of his best men to reclaim the fort. Subsequently a truce was reached in which the Ahmednagar sultanate occupied the island and no further fortification of the island took place. Only a wooden cross remained on the island as a sign of its former rulers. 

However in 1594, Abranches, a Portuguese captain with 1,500 soldiers and 1,500 natives took possession of the fort. The besieged soldiers of the Sultanate tried to block their way by putting a dead elephant at the main gate and a dead horse at the inner gate. But in the end they had to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;konkan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nairne|first=Alexander Kyd|title=History of the Konkan|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=1988|pages=50|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nzPCcILP-XwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=korlai+fort|accessdate=2009-02-05 | isbn=978-81-206-0275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; The Portuguese won the fort but not having enough men to stand guard there chose to destroy it&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; leaving only the central tower and a battery intact. 

Before its destruction, Korlai had been described by travelers as a &quot;magnificent fortress as strong as any other in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; On the inland side - the only place where it was susceptible to be attacked it was protected by a ditch and could only be accessed by a drawbridge. The main entrance was guarded by a bronze lion and the highest tower by a bronze eagle. It housed 7,000 horses and as much men. 

Some parts of it were rebuilt later but now had a garrison of only 50 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; The church within the fort was used for worship on Sundays and holidays. Korlai fort was also strategically very important as it guarded the mouth of the bay. [[Sambhaji]] the son of [[Shivaji]] tried to take it over but failed&lt;ref name=&quot;daiji&quot;/&gt; and had to withdraw his forces on 6 December 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gokhala|first=Kamal Shri Krishna|title=Chhatrapati Sambhaji|publisher=Navakamal Publications|year=1978|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qvy1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=korlai+fort&amp;dq=korlai+fort|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was taken by the Marathas who held it from 1739-1818.

The fort is 2828 feet long, and its average breadth is eighty-nine feet. The enclosing wall is 5' 3&quot; high and has 305 battlements for guns. It is entered by eleven gates - four are outer and seven are inner. At the north point, within pistol-shot of main battery is the water cistern named Santa Cruz - major source of water. The area within the fort walls is divided into three enclosures by two lines of bastioned fortifications. Each of the seven bastions bears the name of a saint. The two westward bastions are named SÃ£o Diego(after [[Didacus of AlcalÃ¡]]) and SÃ£o Francisco (after [[Francis of Assisi]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;daiji&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=911|title=Korlai - The Lesser Known Portuguese Enclave on Konkan Coast |last=Dâ€™Souza|first=Eugene|date=June 23, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others are SÃ£o Pedro, SÃ£o InÃ¡cio, and SÃ£o Filipe.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt;

It has a large rain-water cistern with three mouths, each one foot wide, and the ruins of the magazine and a church.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat Tracks in Maharashtra|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2005|pages=24|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JIjmDLardesC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=korlai|accessdate=2009-01-28 | isbn=978-81-7154-669-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was built in 1630 for the use of the army &lt;ref name=&quot;daiji&quot;/&gt; and was functional until 1728.

There are three Portuguese inscriptions. One, over a doorway in the centre and highest part of the fort (see picture), reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This castle was commanded to be built by the Viceroy of India Dom Filipe Mascarenhas in November of the year 1646 and FernÃ£o Miranda Henriques being Captain of Chaul, and was finished in May 1680, CristÃ³vÃ£o de Abreu de Azevedo being Captain of this fort.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inscription is surmounted by a cross with a coat of arms having the Portuguese stars in the centre and surrounded by seven castles. Other inscriptions over the main entrance and over an altar in the chapel are worn out and undecipherable.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;/&gt; During the brief Maratha rule, some of the names of the bastions were changed but now the only indication of their presence is some dismantled shrines.

'''Karnala fort''' (also called ''Funnel Hill''&lt;ref name=&quot;imperial&quot;/&gt;) is a hill fort in [[Raigad district]] about 10&amp;nbsp;km from [[Panvel]] city. Currently it is a protected place lying within the [[Karnala Bird Sanctuary]]. It was a fort of strategic importance as it overlooked the [[Bor pass]] which connected the [[Konkan coast]] to the interior of Maharashtra ([[Vidharba]])&lt;ref name=&quot;imperial&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter |first=Willam Wilson|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1908|pages=59|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JjooAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=karnala+fort&amp;client=firefox-a|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the main trade route between these areas.

== History ==

Its exact date of formation is not know but likely it predates 1400 CE as under the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Devagiri Yadavs]](1248â€“1318) and under the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughlaq]] rulers (1318â€“1347), Karnala  was the capital of the north Konkan districts  of their respective empires.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt;  It later fell under the command of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]] but in 1540 was taken over by Nizam Shah of [[Ahmednagar Sultanate|Ahmednagar]]. The Gujarat sultans then requested the help of the Dom Francisco de Menenzes the commanding officer of the [[Portuguese in India|Portuguese]] at [[Vasai|Bassien]](modern day Vasai) to win it back. He ordered 500 of his soldiers to Karnala fort and they were able to capture it. The fort was left in charge of the Gujarat Sultanate but with Portuguese garrisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;port&quot;/&gt;

The loss of Karnala enraged the Nizam Shah and he took back the fort and the surrounding countryside by sending 5,000 of his men. The Gujarat sultans fled to Vasai in panic and gave up any claims of the fort to the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=&quot;port&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Danvers|first=Frederick Charles|title=The Portuguese in India : A.D. 1481-1571|publisher=W.H. and Allen|year=1894|pages=452â€“453|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GhAoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=karnala+fort&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA453,M1|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent battle between the Nizam Shah and the Portuguese, the latter were victorious in repulsing further attacks of the Nizam Shahi army and the fort remained with the Portuguese. However the Portuguese viceroy determined that the forts of Sangli and Karnala were of little value to them and decided to  give them to the Nizam Shah for an annual payment of Rs. 17,500(or 5,000 gold pardoas) to further their friendship.&lt;ref name=&quot;port&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt Central Press|year=1883|pages=387|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4bMIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;dq=karnala+fort&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA387,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shivaji]] conquered it from the Portuguese in 1670 by building [[breastworks]] as he advanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt;  After his death in 1680 it was taken over by [[Aurangzeb]]. After this the Mughals occupied it for some time after which it in 1740 with the rise of the [[Peshwas]] of Pune it went to them. It remained under the command of ''killedar'' (garrison commander) Anantrao&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shastri Joshi|first=Venkatesh|title=Vasudeo Balvant Phadke|publisher=D.S.

Karnala fort actually consists of two forts one at a higher level and other lower. At the centre of the higher level is a 125 feet high basalt pillar. It is also called Pandu's tower. This structure was used as watchtower when the fort was occupied however now it is in a ruined condition. The presence of bee hives also makes it difficult to climb and have resulted in at least one casualty in recent times.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat Tracks in Maharashtra|editor=Popular Prakashan|year=2005|pages=17â€“18|isbn=81-7154-669-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JIjmDLardesC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=karnala+fort&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA18,M1|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a water cistern which provides fresh water all year long. From the top the forts of [[Prabalgad]] and Rajmachi are clearly  visible.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;/&gt;

The fort has two inscriptions one in Marathi and the other in Persian. The Marathi inscription which has no date is seen on the lower gate on the inner side. Its words are indecipherable. The Persian writing is on upper gate reads &quot;Syed Nuruddin Muhammad Khan, Hijri, 1147 AH (1735 CE)&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/KOLABA/places_Karnala.html|title=Kolaba District Gazetteer|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably dates from the Mughal occupation of the fort.

'''Laling Qila''' ({{lang-mr|à¤²à¤³à¤¿à¤‚à¤— à¤•à¤¼à¤¿à¤²à¥à¤²à¤¾}}, {{lang-hi|à¤²à¤¾à¤²à¤¿à¤‚à¤— à¤•à¤¼à¤¿à¤²à¤¾}}) is a small fort ([[qila]]) situated in the present day [[Dhule district]] of [[Maharashtra]] state in [[India]]. The fort is situated on top of Laling  hill about {{convert|9.65|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Dhule]] city. It was one of the important forts in the [[Khandesh]] region during the time of the Faruqi Kings. 

==History==

It is a place of considerable antiquity and the fort is supposed to have been built during the reign of the first of the Faruqi Kings. The fact that this fort and not that of [[Thalner]] was granted by Malik Raja (1370-1399) to his eldest son would show that Laling was his chief fort. It was in this fort that Nasir Khan and his son Miran Adil Khan were besieged in 1437 by the [[Bahamani]] general till they were relieved by an army advancing from [[Gujarat]]. Early in the seventeenth century it is mentioned more than once in connection with the movements of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] troop's [[Deccan]] campaigns [Ellior, VII, 35, 102.]. In 1862, the fort is described, as strongly situated with very few defenses left.

==Present condition==

Around the fort is a small village called as Laling village with 1,549 inhabitants in 1961. Laling besides the fort has two ''[[Hemadpanthi]]'' temples in dilapidated condition. There is also a mined ''hemadpanti'' well. Presently the fort is in a ruined and collapsed state. It offers breathtaking panoramic view of Dhule city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3485">In 1803 the '''Pettah of Ahmednagar''',&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley ''Supplementary despatches...'' it is spelt '''Pettah of Ahmednuggur'''&lt;/ref&gt; had forty bastions, or round towers: eight of them were large, with two guns in each; the remainder had only loopholes. There were twelve gates, without any detached works for defence. The walls were of mud, about 10 feet high without a ditch.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100&gt;Arthur Richard Wellesley Wellington, ''Supplementary despatches and memoranda of field marshal Arthur duke of Wellington 1797-1819 with a map of India'', J. Murray, 1859. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?dq=Pettah+of+Ahmednuggur&amp;pg=PA100&amp;id=y9EgAAAAMAAJ p. 100]. Arthur Wellesley &quot;Memorandum of the Ahmednuggur Fort&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gunshot to the east of the [[Wiktionary:pettah|pettah]] was the [[Fort of Ahmednagar]]. A small river came from the northward, round the west side of the pettah, and passed to the southward of the fort. A [[nullah]] also passed from the northward, between the fort and a town called [[Bhingar]], about a gunshot to the eastward, and joined the river.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

Two nills or covered aqueducts came from the hills, a mile or more to the north, passed through and supplied the pettah and the town, and then went into the fort, either under or through the ditch, into which the waste water fell.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

==Capture during Second Anglo-Maratha War==
In 1803 during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], forces under the command of Sir [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later the Duke of Wellington) stormed and captured the small town.

Wellesley sent forward his stormers against the pettah, having first pointed out to the leaders where they were to fix their ladders. The assault was gallantly led; but within ten minutes five of the officers leading the first attacking party were killed or wounded, the ladders were thrown down and broken; the attack had failed.&lt;ref name=Fitchett&gt;Fitchett, William Henry &quot;Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of, 1769-1852&quot;, London : G. Bell, 1911. [http://www.archive.org/stream/greatduke01fitcuoft#page/102/mode/1up pp.102â€“104].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attacking party had only two ladders; the rush of the stormers broke down one; but, on the other, the stormers, headed by Captain Vesey, forced their way up. About 150 men had gained the rampart when a cannon-shot smashed the ladder. The fate of the stormers, thus cut off, might have seemed hopeless; but they leaped down the inner side of the wall, forced their way through the streets to the central gate, against which another party of stormers was battering on the outside, opened it, let in their comrades, and the town was won. Wellesley then turned his attention to the nearby fort.&lt;ref name=Fitchett/&gt;

The successful assault carried out with such apparent ease made a strong impression on Wellesley's opponents. A Mahratta chief wrote to a friend shortly after the incident:
{{cquote|The English, are a strange people, and their general an extraordinary man. They arrive here in the morning, examine the walls, carry them, have killed all the garrison in the place, and have now gone back to breakfast. Who can resist such men as these?|||A Mahratta chief.&lt;ref name=Fitchett/&gt;}}

The '''Ahmednagar Fort''' is located in the heart of the city of [[Ahmednagar]],&lt;ref&gt;In some older references '''Fort of Ahmednuggur'''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kishore|first=B.R.|title=India - A Travel Guide|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|pages=628|isbn=81-284-0067-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=COHI7LlpkSAC&amp;pg=PA627&amp;dq=panhala+fort&amp;lr=&amp;ei=cfZ4SY-3GYL4lQTiq8mJAg&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA628,M1|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the headquarters of the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]]. In 1803 it was taken by the British in during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]]. Later it was used by the [[British Raj]] as a prison. Currently the fort is under the administration of the [[Indian Army Armoured Corps|Armoured Corps]] of the Indian Army.

== Major features ==

In 1803 the Ahmednagar Fort was round in appearance, with twenty-four bastions, one large gate, and three small sally ports. It had a [[glacis]], no covered way; a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]], revetted with stone on both sides, about {{convert|18|ft|m}} wide, with {{convert|9|ft|m}} water all round, which only reached within 6 or {{convert|7|ft|m}} of the top of the [[counterscarp|scarp]]; long reeds grew in it all round. The [[berm]] was only about one yard wide. The rampart was of black hewn stone; the parapet of brick in chunam, and both together appeared from the crest of the glacis to be only as high as the pole of a field-officer's tent. The bastions were all about 4Â½ feet higher; they were round. One of them mounted eight guns ''en barbet'': it pointed to the eastward; all the rest had jingies, four in each. In 1803 two guns were visible in each bastion, and 200 were said to be ready in the fort to be mounted.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100&gt;Arthur Richard Wellesley Wellington, ''Supplementary despatches and memoranda of field marshal Arthur duke of Wellington 1797-1819 with a map of India'', J. Murray, 1859. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?dq=Pettah+of+Ahmednuggur&amp;pg=PA100&amp;id=y9EgAAAAMAAJ p. 100]. Arthur Wellesley &quot;Memorandum of the Ahmednuggur Fort&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gunshot to the west of the fort was the [[Pettah of Ahmednagar]]. The main gate of the fort faced the pettah, and was defended by a small half-circular work, with one traverse and several little towers for men. There is was a wooden bridge over the ditch, which could be taken away in time of war, but it was not a drawbridge. It was reported that an iron trough as large as the bridge, could be placed upon it, or on the supporters of it, and fill with charcoal or other combustibles, to which could be ignited as an enemy approached.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

A small river came from the northward, round the west side of the pettah, and passed to the southward of the fort. A [[nullah]] also passed from the northward, between the fort and a town called [[Bhingar]], about a gunshot to the eastward, and joined the river. A potential defensive weakness was a little hill or rising ground close to and east of Bhingar, from which shot from siege guns could reach the fort.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

Two nills or covered aqueducts came from the hills, a mile or more to the north, passed through and supplied the pettah and the town, and then went into the fort, either under or through the ditch, into which the waste water fell.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

There were no passages across the ditch from the sally ports, and no part of the aqueducts appeared above the ditch. The nullah mentioned above, had steep banks and passed within 60 yards of the fort; the aqueduct from Bhingar passed under it. There was no bridge or even a prominent crossing point at the nullah and hence no clearly defined route between the fort and the town of Bhingar.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

There were many small pagodas and mosques round the pettah and the fort, but none exactly between, or between the fort and Bhingar, or nearer to the fort than those towns.&lt;ref name=Wellesley-100/&gt;

== History ==

[[Aurangzeb]] died at Ahmednagar fort at the age of 88 on February 20, 1707.After Aurangzeb's death the fort passed to the Nizams in 1724, to Marathas in 1759 and later the [[Scindia]]s in 1790. During the period of instability in the Maratha Empire following the death of [[Madhavrao II]], [[Daulat Scindia]] had the fort and its surrounding region ceded to him. In 1797, he imprisoned [[Nana Phadanvis]] the Peshwa diplomat at Ahmednagar fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency |publisher=Govt.

'''Thalner''' ({{lang-mr|à¤¥à¤¾à¤³à¤¨à¥‡à¤°}}), the first capital of the [[Faruqi dynasty|Faruqi]] kings, stands on the [[Tapti River|Tapi]] river, in [[Shirpur]] tehsil about 46.67&amp;nbsp;km. (28 miles) north-east of [[Dhule]] in the [[Maharashtra]] state of [[India]]. It was fortified by a strong fort which played a very significant role in the history of Khandesh. Situated on the banks of the Tapi and the foot of the fort is an old stone built temple dedicated to Thaleshwar. The name ''Thalner'' probably derived from this old temple of ''Thaleshwar''. In the heyday of the Gavali or [[Ahir]] kings, Thalner was at the height of its prosperity and was an important commercial centre on the [[Surat]]-[[Burhanpur]] road. Today it is just a small village which lost its glory to history.

==Thalner fort==

The fort is described as with one side rising out of the [[Tapti River|Tapi]] and the three other sides surrounded by a hollow way, varying in width from 91.44 to 137.16 metres (100 to 150 yards). The walls rise to the height of about 18.28 metres (60&amp;nbsp;ft.) above this hollow and the interior had the same elevation. The only entrance was on the eastern side and secured by five successive gates communicating by intricate traverses, whose enclosure gradually rose to the height of the main wall. A winding ramp interspersed in some places with steps, ascending through the gate in to the terreplein of the rampart. Great ingenuity had been exercised to make this part as strong as possible apparently under the idea that the profile of the rest rendered it secure, notwithstanding the absence of a ditch.&lt;br /&gt; 
Today only a small portion of the walls that were on the river side is standing, the others having collapsed for the most part. Even of this wall one of the bastions was ruined by the great floods of the Tapi which took place in 1876, and a tunnel opened in which a small, well executed idol of [[Vishnu]] was found. 
Situated on the banks of the Tapi and the foot of the fort is an old stone built temple dedicated to Thaleshwar. Its 1.828 X 1.828 metre vestibule contains a small ''[[Lingam|ling]]'' symbol. It is crowned by a 7.62 metre (25&amp;nbsp;ft.) high ''[[Sikhara|shikhar]]''

==History==
According to a local grant, in the beginning of the twelfth century (1128), while the country for 32.18&amp;nbsp;km. (20 miles) round was ' without a light', and twenty-seven of its forts were deserted, Thalner prospered under Javaji and Govaji of the Tale sub-division of Gavalis or Ahirs. At that time, Daulatrao, son of Bajirao of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] came to the people of [[Khandesh]], and finding Thalner flourishing established Javaji's family as headmen of the town. 

Late in the fourteenth century (1370) when [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Firozshah Tughluq]] (1351â€“1388) granted [[Faruqi dynasty#Malik Raja|Malik Raja Faruqi]] an estate on the south border of [[Gujarat]], Malik chose Thalner as his headquarters. In the following year (1371), defeated by the Gujarat king, Malik was forced to take refuge in Thalner fort. On his death in 1399 Malik left Thalner to his second son Iftikar Khan. But in 1417 with the aid of the Sultan of [[Malwa]], Nasir Khan, the elder son, wrested it from his brother. In 1498 Thalner was invaded by [[Mahmud Begada]], king of Gujarat, whose army laid waste the district and would not retire till arrears of tribute were paid.  In 1511 Mahmud Begada granted Thalner with about one-half of Khandesh to Malik Hissamuddin a noble of his court. But in the next year, Hissamuddin was murdered and Thalner restored to Khandesh.  In 1566 it was the scene of the- defeat of the Khandesh king [[Faruqi dynasty#Miran Muhammad Shah II|Miran Muhammad Shah II]] by Changiz Khan of Gujarat.  In 1600, when it passed to the Emperor [[Akbar]], Thalner is noticed as being of great strength though in a plain.  In 1660 [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier|Tavernier]] mentions it as one of the places of trade on the [[Surat]] and [[Burhanpur]] line. 

In 1750 it was a strong fort, the centre of thirty-two little governments.  Shortly after it passed to the [[Peshwa]], and was by him made over to [[Holkar]], who about 1800, pledged it to the [[Nimbalkar]]s. It was recovered in the following year and kept by the Holkar family till in 1818 under the terms of the [[Mandsaur Fort|Mandesar]] treaty, it was handed over to the [[British Raj|British]].

===Battle of Thalner (1818)===

[[Sendhwa|Sindva]], was a place with  much greater name for strength in Khandesh region, but it surrendered to the British at once, hence no resistance was expected at Thalner. But its capture proved one of the bloodiest incidents in the conquest of Khandesh. Blacker gave the following detailed account of the conquest .  

''When in 1818 Sir Thomas Hislop, the British general, came to take possession, the garrison began hostilities by firing [[matchlock]]s at the [[palanquin]] of a sick officer, and at the same time opened fire with a gun on the head of the baggage, then entering the plain. A summons was sent to the commandant, and a close reconnaissance of the place was made. The party descended into the ravines surrounding the fort, and from there ascended into the town driving out a small party of the enemy. As it was ascertained that the enemy had no guns on the western face, where there was water and comparatively clear ground on the river bank, General Hislop resolved to encamp there, and attack the place from the north-east angle. With this object two five and a half inch [[howitzer]]s with ten [[six pounder]]s, the only guns in the camp, were moved down the beds of the ravines. They were then carried to positions in the town, where the houses gave tolerable cover to batteries which opened within 273.403 and 328.083 metres (250 and 300 yards) of the north-east angle of the fort. In a few hours, during which, by the well aimed fire of matchlocks from the walls, several casualties had occurred, the enemy guns were nearly silenced, but no progress had been made in reducing the garrison, who it was thought, would surrender as soon as any serious demonstration was made against them.'' 

''Further examination showed that the outer gate was in a ruinous state, and promised cover in traverses, while a commanding position immediately opposite to it overlooked the nearest defences. For these reasons it was determined to attack the gates. Two guns were opened on the traverses, with considerable effect, while two others were, by a detour, brought to a position whence, with the view of blowing it open, they might easily be run up to the gate. At the same time a storming party, was brought down to the same place. Indifferent as the enemy had hitherto been, the preparations against the gate did not fail to alarm them and they sent out to demand terms of capitulation. In reply they were told that unconditional surrender would alone be accepted; and they were invited to avail themselves of this offer before the assault on the gates should begin.''

''The evening was now advanced and the enemy probably trusted to the approaching darkness for an opportunity of abandoning the place. To prevent this the guns and storming party were ordered to advance to the gate. This was done without loss. It was found that in consequence of its ruinous state there was a passage for single files between the wall and the gate frame; and no opposition being offered from within, the storming party, followed by the pioneers, entered, though tediously, without difficulty. After the passage of the storming party endeavours were used to blow open the outer gate that the guns might be advanced to the remainder. But before that was effected the storming party had passed through the second gate without opposition. At the third it was met by the commandant, with a number of artificers whom he had on the previous evening forced in.''

''Lieut. Colonels Conway and Murray, with several others, had entered with the storming party, and it was still doubtful whether resistance would ultimately be made, for at this time there was none. They accordingly passed through the fourth gate, which, as well as the second, appeared so much out of repair as to be incapable of being shut; but at the fifth or last gate they were stopped though the wicket was opened. A hurried conversation about the terms of surrender now took place. It was probably little intelligible under the circumstances of noise and apprehension which attended it. Colonel Murray, in this state of uncertainty, concluding that there was an urgent necessity for establishing a footing such as would secure eventual success of the attack, should the enemy hold out, entered by the wicket with Major Gordon and their [[grenadier]]s; but refrained from drawing his sword, to show that he had no intention of breaking the [[parley]].''

''He expected to be followed by as many men as should be able to maintain themselves in a confined situation; but four or five persons only had got in, when the enemy, apprehending the consequences, attacked most furiously, and in a moment laid them all dead, except Colonel Murrav, who, covered with wounds, fell towards the wicket. They then attempted to close the wicket, but their efforts were rendered ineffectual by a grenadier who thrust his musket into the aperture, While Lieut. Colonel Mackintosh and Captain Mac Craith forced it open. In this state it was held while, the Captain with one hand was dragging Colonel Murray through it, and warding off blows with his sword in the other. A fire was now poured in through the wicket, which cleared the gateway sufficiently for the head of the storming party, under Major MacGregor of the Royals, to enter; and the place was carried without further difficulty, but at the expense of that officer's life.[ Two tombs, erected to the memory of the officers killed, bear the following inscriptions; No. I &quot; Here lie entombed the remains of Major R. Mac Gregor. of H. M's Royal Scots, who fell in the assault and storming of this fort on the 27th Feby. 1818.&quot; No. II &quot;Here lie entombed the remains of Major.1. Gordon, of H.M.'s Royal Scots, who fell in the assault and storming of this fort on the 27th February 1818&quot;..] ''

''As soon as the supporting detachment could open the gate, many troops poured in, the garrison was shortly put to the sword, and the commandant was hanged on the same evening to a tree on the flagstaff tower. The enemy lost about 250 men killed, the British loss was twenty-five. According to a local story some of the garrison escaped by leaping into the river from the battlements, with bundles of ivari stalks in their arms. A somewhat different account, severely blaming Sir T. Hislop for hanging the commandant, is given in the summary of ''The Maratha and Pendhari Campaign (1820)''

==Present Condition==

The fort of Thalner is in a dilapidated condition. Besides the tombs of Major MacGregor and Captain Gordon, the chief objects of interest are ten [[Mohammedan|Muhammedan]] domed tombs of common country black stone and two of burnt brick. Of the whole number, one is eight cornered and the rest are square. They vary in size from eleven feet by eleven to three and a half feet square. Though more or less damaged outwardly and with the inside part of their domes partly destroyed, they are in good order. The eight-cornered tomb has some Arabic writing, but so worn as to be unreadable. According to the local story they were built by a saint. But there seems little reason to doubt that they are the tombs of the Faruqi kings, of whom four; Malik Raja (1396), Malik Nasir (1437), Miran Adil Khan (1441) and Miran Mubarak Khan (1457), were buried in Thalner. Inside there are also a few wells which once supplied water to the garrison, but now they are dry. Much of the earth from inside the fort has been utilised by the villagers in building houses.

==Tourist attractions==

In Thalner there are two temples,one is Lord Mahadeva's and Second one is Lord Khandoba's Temple.
Lord Mahadeva's temple is located at tapi riverside, and Khandoba temple is located near to Thalner Bus Stand Only.
 
[[Khandoba]], (Marathi: à¤–à¤‚à¤¡à¥‹à¤¬à¤¾,Khaá¹‡á¸obÄ) also known as Khanderao, Khanderaya, Malhari Martand and Mallu Khan is a regional Hindu deity, worshipped as MÄrtanda Bhairava, a form of Shiva, mainly in the Deccan plateau of India. He is the most popular family deity in Maharashtra.[1] He is also the patron deity of warrior, farming, herding as well as some Brahmin (priest) castes, the hunters and gatherers of the hills and forests. The cult of Khandoba has linkages with Vaishnava and Jain traditions, and also assimilates all communities irrespective of caste, including Muslims. Khandoba is sometimes identified with Mallanna of Andhra Pradesh and Mailara of Karnataka. The worship of Khandoba developed during the 9th and 10th centuries from a folk deity into a composite god possessing the attributes of Shiva, Bhairava, Surya and Karttikeya (Skanda). He is depicted either in the form of a Lingam, or as an image riding on a bull or a horse. The foremost centre of Khandoba worship is Jejuri in Maharashtra. The legends of Khandoba, found in the text Malhari Mahatmya and also narrated in folk songs, revolve around his victory over demons Mani-malla and his marriages

There is one festival in Hinduism call Champa Shashti which comes exactly after one month of Diwali Festival. Deshasth Brahmans and Marathas observe the Champasashthi festival every year in honour of Khandoba. The festival begins on the bright half of the Hindu month of Margshirsha. The images of Khandoba and Malla are cleaned and worshipped. For six days a fast is observed. On the seventh day the worshippers break their fast by a feast known as the Champasashtliiche parne. An invitation to this feast is regarded as an invitation from the god Khandoba himself and is harder to refuse.

An important part of the Khandoba-cult is navas, a vow to perform service to the god in return for a boon of good harvest, male child, financial success etc. On fulfilment of the navas, Khandoba was offered children or some devotees would afflict pain by hook-swinging or fire-walking.
This type of worship using navas is called Sakama Bhakti - worship done with an expectation of return and is considered &quot;to be of a lower esteem&quot;.But the most faithful bhaktas (devotees) are considered to be greedy only for the company of their Lord, Khandoba is also called bhukela - hungry for such true bhaktas in Martanda Vijaya.

Boys called VÄghyÄ (or Waghya, literally &quot;tigers&quot;) and girls called Muraá¸¹i were formerly dedicated to Khandoba, but now the practice of marrying girls to Khandoba is illegal. The Vaghyas act as the bards of Khandoba and identify themselves with the dogs of Khandoba, while Muralis act as his courtesans (devanganas - nymphs or devadasis). The Vaghyas and their female counterparts Muralis sing and dance in honour of Khandoba and narrate his stories on jagarans - all night song-festivals, which are sometimes held after navas fulfilment. Another custom was ritual-suicide by Viras (heroes) in the cult. According to legend, an &quot;untouchable&quot; Mang (Matanga) sacrificed himself for the foundation of the temple at Jejuri to persuade Khandoba to stay at Jejuri forever.[47] Other practices in the cult include the belief that Khandoba possesses the body of a Vaghya or devrsi (shaman). Another ritual in the cult is an act of chain-breaking in fulfilment of a vow or an annual family rite; the chain is identified with the snake around Shiva's neck, which was cut by the demons in the fight. Another rite associated with the family duties to please Khandoba is the tali bharne, which is to be performed every full moon day. A tali (dish) is filled with coconuts, fruits, betel nuts, saffron, turmeric (Bhandar) and Bel leaves. Then, a coconut is placed on a pot filled with water and the pot is worshipped as an embodiment of Khandoba. Then, five persons lift the tali, place it repeatedly on the pot thrice, saying &quot;Elkot&quot; or &quot;Khande rayacha Elkot&quot;. Then the coconut in the tali is broken and mixed with sugar or jaggery and given to friends and relatives. A gondhal is performed along with the tali bharne.A gondhal is a ritualistic folk art in which the performer Gondhalis invoke the deities.

'''Hazrat Haji Malang Sha Sarkar rahymattullha taala alhy. ''' (also called '''Baba Malang''') is a hill fort located in [[Raigad District]], [[Maharashtra]]. It has an elevation of 789 m above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|title=Friends of Forts|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next higher level is called the Sone Machi as it is the lower part of the fort. This is a projection of rock with is 70 feet broad and 100 feet long. It is shaped like an elephant trunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;thesis&quot; /&gt; It has a parapet wall with bastions on two sides but there are no [[machicolation]]s to fire at the an invading army. 

The highest level is the Citadel which is 200 yards long and 70 yards broad. This is the summit of the hill and has no fortifications. The water supply is from five cisterns at the top of the hill with a copper pipe to carry water to the lower levels. 

Haji Malang is different from other forts in Maharashtra. Whereas other forts have several gates and multiple watchtowers,art of the main gate itself. With a wall with no [[machicolations]] to fire at the enemy and no fortifications,Haji Malang is one of the few forts to depend completely on natural aspects of the hill to defend itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;thesis&quot; /&gt;

== History ==

Haji Malang.&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thesis&quot; /&gt; His is the oldest name associated with Haji Malang and he is said to have improved access to the hill by means of an iron bridge.

The permissions from Forest Department took 4 years to come and the work has now started.  The Malanggad Funicular Railway will be more than 1 Km in length and will gain 320 M in height.   It will be able to carry 1000 passengers up and down the hill every one hour.

In most places the steepness of the rock has been increased by artificial [[escarpment|scarp]]ing and it has been strengthened by a parapet wall of Kolhapur black stone fourteen feet high.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt Central Press|year=1886|pages=316â€“317|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=asAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=pavangad#PPA316,M1|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, under Shahoji I (1821â€“1837), Pavangad and its neighboring fort [[Panhala fort|Panhala]] were given over to the British Raj. In 1844, during the minority of [[Shivaji IV]] (1837â€“1860), Panhala and Pavangad were taken by rebels who seized Colonel Ovans, the Resident of [[Satara]], when he was on tour and imprisoned him in Panhala. A British force under General Delamotte was sent against the rebels and on 1 December 1844 breached Panhala fort walls, took it by storm. Shortly thereafter in 1844, the two main entrances of Pawangad were pulled down and the fort was dismantled. The fort though deserted has a good water supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot; /&gt;

'''''Bhamer''''', ({{lang-mr|à¤­à¤¾à¤®à¥‡à¤°}}) is a village with a historical fort in [[Sakri]] [[tehsil]] of [[Maharashtra]] state in [[India]]. It is  situated at the foot of a great fortified hill lying 48.28&amp;nbsp;km. (30 miles) north-west from [[Dhule]] city and 4.82&amp;nbsp;km. (3 miles) south of [[Nijampur Dhule|Nijampur]]. 

==History==

In olden days it was a stone built town  surrounded by a parapet wall. Today it is no more than a village strewn with ruins of the old buildings. The wall surrounding it has become loose and broken down at many places. On the west is a gate flanked by two round towers, almost in ruins, with two monolithic stone pillars about 2.743 metres (9&amp;nbsp;ft.) high and four gate posts, one of them in its place and the others lying at some distance.

 
The old stone palace with two entrance gates and which served as a government office during [[Peshwa]]'s time is almost tottering. On one of these gates is carved an animal like a heraldic lion, with a circular shield on the right. At either end is an archway and between the arches on each side of the roadway is a raised terrace between 1.524 and 1.628 metres (five and six feet) high. On each terrace stand two pillars each of the height of about 3.66 metres (12&amp;nbsp;ft.) and behind each pillar in the side wall is a pilaster, and in each end wall in a line with the pillars are other pilasters. 

There is a [[Hemadpanthi|hemadpanti]] or as it is locally known as '' Gavali Raj'' reservoir near this gateway. Not far from it, ruins of a [[mosque]] could be seen. 

===Bhamer Fort===

 
Bhamer, however, is known for its fort known after the village name and more so for the caves or rather monks dwellings that are in the escarpments of the hills above the village. The fort located at the cast end of a rugged irregular range of rocky hills is divided from the rest of the range by an artificial chasm. The natural escarpment of the fort that overlooks the village has been strengthened in places by masonry constructions. Though the hill is of a considerable height, the ascent is easy and roundabout. On the southern face is the entrance leading into the fort. Inside are several cisterns of good water as also four large store rooms hollowed out of the rock. There are many ruined gateways and gates and nearly ruined towers. Time has also withered away the artificial fortifications at many places. It is supposed that the town was destroyed while punishing Kale Khan, a Muslim rebel, who had seized it in 1736. It never regained its original glory. 

A remarkable feature in the fort is that its buildings are mostly underground, the escarpment being honeycombed with caves, some of them plain and shapeless, but others regular buildings with pillar-supported roofs. These caves are locally known as ''Gavali Raja'''s houses. Some of these seem to be of great age while yet others apparently much modern. All the important caves face south-west, and are nearly on one level like the ones at [[Ellora]] (''Verul'') in [[Aurangabad district, Maharashtra|Aurangabad district]]. 

The rock generally overhangs the doorways and another rising in front forms a sort of a parapet. The first set of three caves open into each other. The middle cave about 2.229 m2 (24 sq. ft.) is the largest. The partition walls are very thin and there is no carving. Tool marks all over the walls indicate that the caves are not only artificial but also unfinished. The next set of caves, also three in number, consists of a large irregularly shaped central and two side caves divided by rock partitions through both of which openings have been made. The roof of the central cave is supported by three columns of rock left to serve as pillars. In two of these pillars, grooves, one in each pillar, have been cut, apparently to support lamps or screen. 

Beyond this second group are two other caves neither of which is remarkable. About 45.720 metres (50 yds.) further is a water cave divided by a wall of rock about 0.431 metres (15&amp;nbsp;inches) thick. The mouth of this reservoir has been divided lengthwise into three parts by using two stone pillars. 

The next group of three caves was formerly used as the fort office. Of these three caves the first is divided by two rows of regularly shaped pillars with pilasters corresponding to them in the walls. It has had a verandah 22.555 metres (74&amp;nbsp;ft.) in length with an unfinished cell at the left. The doorway has a lintel. The side posts are fluted to the ground and moulded about half way down. In the fluting below the moulded part, are, on the left side of the doorway, two figures about 0.431 metres (15&amp;nbsp;inches) high. They seem to be male and female serving as ''chopdars'' or mace bearers. There is also an unidentifiable figure on the right doorpost. There are a number of rude sculptures on the walls of these caves, of [[Parshvanath]] and other [[Jain]]s, much defaced from the decay of the rock, but apparently of the same coarse rough type as those on the ''Chamar Lena'' hill. The second cave is in very good preservation and its pillars are divided into successive portions, alternately round and square. The third cave is like, the other two. 

Beyond these three caves, with a long narrow opening, is a great square hole about 6.09 metres (20&amp;nbsp;ft.) deep and a little more than 6.09 metres (20&amp;nbsp;ft.) long and broad. This was used as a dungeon for the prisoners. On the other side of the hill, facing north-east, is an unimportant cave. and in the same side facing north towards [[Nijampur Dhule|Nijampur]], is a whole range of caves said to be inaccessible.

is about 2&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mandangad]] town in [[Ratnagiri District]], [[Maharashtra]]. This fort was captured by [[Shivaji]] in the battle with [[Adil Shah]]. A 400 years old cannon is the major feature of the fort. The fort constitutes a Ganapati Temple and a tank called Thorla Talav. 

It actually consists of three separate fortifications - Mandangad proper to the south, Parkot in the middle while Jamba in the north. The Jamba water reservoir is now dry. Even though they are believed be much older, local legend attributes Mandangad to [[Shivaji]], Parkot to Habshi of the [[Siddi]]s and Jamba to [[Kanhoji Angre]](also called Angria). All three forts were captured in 1818 by a Col Kennedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

'''Vijaydurg''' (sometimes written as Viziadrug), the oldest fort on the [[Sindhudurg]] coast, was constructed during the regime of Raja [[Bhoja II]] of the [[Shilahara|Shilahar dynasty]] (construction period 1193-1205). The fort was earlier known as &quot;Gheria&quot;, as it is situated close to the village of &quot;Girye&quot;. Shivaji captured this fort from  [[Adil Shah]] of Bijapur in 1653 and renamed it as &quot;Vijay Durg&quot; as the then Hindu solar year's name was &quot;Vijay&quot; (Victory).

Earlier, the fort encompassed an area of 5 acres (1 acre = 4840 square yards or 4047 square metres) and was surrounded by sea on all four sides. Over the years the eastern trench was reclaimed and a road constructed thereon. Presently the area of fort is about 17 acres and is surrounded by the Arabian Sea on three sides. Shivaji extended the area of the fort by constructing three walls on the eastern side, each 36 metres high. He also constructed 20 bastions.

According to legend, this is one of only two Maratha forts where Shivaji personally hoisted the saffron flag.  The other fort is &quot;Torana&quot;. 

Vijaydurg Fort was called the &quot;Eastern Gibraltar&quot;, as it was virtually impregnable. Its locational advantages include the 40&amp;nbsp;km long Waghotan/Kharepatan creek.  Large vessels cannot enter the shallow water of this creek. Also, Maratha warships could be anchored in this creek and yet remain invisible from the sea. It is a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise|url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location==
Located in [[Devgarh, Maharashtra|Devgad Taluka]], Vijaydurg and its surroundings are famous all over the world for the delicious [[Alphonso (mango)|Alphonso mangoes]]. During the growing season, the smell of mango blossom hangs heavy in the air. Mango plantations are everywhere; along with fishing and farming, mango cultivation is a primary occupation of the people in Devgad.

==Features of Architectural Interest==
1) According to unconfirmed reports, there is a 200m long, undersea/underland tunnel from the fort to the palatial Dhulap house in the village{{fact|date=April 2012}}. Supposedly, the roof of the tunnel has been pinched to protect it from landslides and it is also well ventilated.  Now the tunnel is partially blocked. If the presence of the tunnel can be confirmed, and the tunnel cleared, it could serve as a tourist attraction of historical and architectural interest.

2) Recent oceanographic evidence supports the existence of an undersea wall, constructed out at sea at a depth of 8â€“10 m depth undersea{{fact|date=April 2012}}. Made of laterite, the wall is estimated to be 122 mtrs long, 3 mtrs high &amp; 7 mtrs broad. Attacking ships often met a watery grave after colliding against this wall.

3)1.5&amp;nbsp;km from the fort up the Waghotan Creek, exist the remains of a naval dock carved from rock{{fact|date=April 2012}}. This is where Maratha warships were built and repaired.  The ships built here were of the 400-500 tonnage capacity.  This 109*70 mt dock faces the north side and is an achievement of Maratha naval architecture.

The top of the fort was built using a combination of dressed stone and brickwork. There is a tank with an idol of Lord [[Hanuman]] and a tunnel 5m wide. The fort has a pointed cliff named Shembi. You can find caves at the base. One end of the fort shows a domical structure. The eastern face shows a fearsome cliff named [[Ikhara]] which is ideal for rock climbers.
One Temple situated in one of the caves is in good condition. Few other caves are also seen around and are quite big in size. Also Trunk of Dhodap fort is in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most Interesting thing we came across is that there is &quot;Cow of stone&quot; moving inside the this hill. It's hear by the peoples in the nearby villages that on every &quot;Vasubaras&quot;, this Cow moves inside by the distance of 4 grains.

PrabalGad (fort):


This fort was built to keep an eye on the ancient ports of Panvel and Kalyan situated in North Konkan. From the study of the caves in this fort it is estimated that it belongs to the time of Buddha. The Shilahar and Yadav dynasties made it an army camp because of the strong man-made caves engraved in this fort and named it â€˜Muranjanâ€™. It was built at the time of the Bahamani Empire. Afterwards it came under the Nizam Shahi dynasty of Ahmednagar. When the Nizam Shahi dynasty was on the verge of collapse, Shahaji Raje came to their support, but the Mughal emperor Shahajehan and Adil Shah of Bijapur both sent their army separately to defeat Shahaji. When Shahaji came to know this, he moved his army to fort Kondhana and fort Murumbdev. He then requested help against the Mughal and Adilshahi forces from Siddhis of Janjira, but was refused. So Shahaji tried to get help from the Portuguese in the city of Chaul, but failed again. Finally Shahaji, with his wife Jijabai and son young Shivaji moved on Muranjan fort along with army. Later in 1636 Shivaji left Muranjan fort. In the same year 1636  the Agreement of Mahuli was made according to which the North Konkan went under the Mughal Empire who granted authority to Adilshaha of Vijapur to rule the area in return for tribute. Shivaji grabbed this opportunity. He defeated More of Javli and captured the Javli area.At the same time a brave Sardar of Shivaji, Abaji Mahadev won the area of Kalyan, Bhiwandi and Rayri. That time fort Muranjan came under swarajya of Shivaji. Shivaji changed the name of this fort from â€œMuranjan&quot; to &quot;Prabalgad&quot; (Prabal means &quot;strong&quot;). Later on, in 1665, according to Treaty of Purandar, Prabalgad was one of the twenty-three forts which were handed over to the Mughal empire. The Mughal Sardar Jaysingh placed a Rajput named Kesarsingh Hada in charge of the fort Prabalgad. In 1658, the Marathas under Shivaji re-took the fort once again. The Mughal Sardar Kesar Singh committed suicide realising that defeat was imminent. The Rajput ladies in the fort commited Jauhar (self-immolation) to escape dishonour. The mother and son of Kesar Singh who had hidden themselves in the fort were granted freedom by the order of Shivaji. In the investigation of the fort great amount of wealth was found.

'''Prabalgad Bhatkanti:''' 

The flat top area of the fort is covered by dense forest. There is a Ganesh Temple at the top. There are also some scenic ruins of old buildings and a few water tanks. In order to explore them you will need a local guide. The British Government wanted to develop Prabalgad as a hill station like Matheran but were thwarted in this plan on account of the difficulties caused by the lack of water which, though sufficient for the existing residents, would not have met the requirements if more people had come to stay as per their plan. Because of the dense forest it is not always easy to find paths for walking, but if you persevere and reach the   top of the fort you will be rewarded with a panoramic view of the of different points of Matheran, the neighbouring hill-station.

'''Kalavantin Durg (Fort):''' 

This fort is just opposite to Prabalgad. It is also visible from Mumbai-Pune highway. According to stories, the fort was built for a queen named Kalavantin. Steps leading up to the fort have been cut into the rock face of the hill. From the peak of this hill you can see Matheran, Chanderi, Peb, Ershal, and Karnala forts, and also the Mumbai city. The Adivasi People of Machi-Prabal village observe the custom of dancing on every Holi (Shimga) Festival at the top of Kalavantin  fort. These people have a long-standing relationship with this fort and it has become a part of their heritage.

'''How to Reach To the Fort?'''


This fort is visible from Mumbai- Pune highway. There is a way to fort from Shedung village which is at the point where the Kalamboli-Mumbai bypass road meets the Mumbai-Pune highway. 6 seater Minidor auto-rickshaws are available from Gandhi Hospital and Old Panvel to Thakurwadi. For a group of 10 people the auto-rickshaw (Minidor) fare  is around Rs. 200 to 250. Another choice is to catch the hourly State-Transport bus at the Panvel Bus Depot. The bus fare from Panvel to Thakurwadi bus is Rs. 14 per person. Thakurwadi is the terminal stop of this bus, and from Thakurwadi onwards you can complete your journey to the   fort on foot.

'''Mahuli Fort'''
At 2815&amp;nbsp;ft., this is a popular trekking destination and a paradise for rock-climbers because of many nearby pinnacles with interesting names like Vazir, Vishnu, etc., given by the local trekking and climbing fraternity. This mountain complex is actually a group of two or more hills with common cols and pinnacles.

It is the highest point in the [[Thane District|Thane district]].  The forest surrounding Mahuli has been declared as a sanctuary. Once Shahaji Raje, father of [[Shivaji|Chatrapati Shivaji]] Maharaj, had this fortress under his belt. The fort has been declared as a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url= http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/images/list-of-protected-monuments-n-forts.pdf|title= List of the protected monuments of Mumbai Circle district-wise|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Besides an open Shiva temple there is a small perennial drinking water cistern on top, three caves of which the larger can be used as overnight shelter, like as on many other such natural hill forts of Maharashtra Western Ghats (Sahyadri Range). There is a stone arch historically known as the 'Kalyan Darwaja' but the dome of the arch is now broken. 



== Reaching there ==

Asangaon on Mumbai-Nashik highway (91) km from Mumbai. 5&amp;nbsp;km inside on to the left is the Mahuli village. The nearest railway station to Mahuli is [[Asangaon]]. One can catch either Asangaon or Kasara Local from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus|Mumbai CST]], which could also be caught at Kalyan Junction. 

If coming by train, alight at Asangaon railway station, cross the national highway (commonly known as 'Agra Road'), walk about 1 km towards Shahpur on the highway. Turn left on the road going to Manas Mandir (a religious place for the Jain community), walk further 15-20 minutes, don't turn right for Manas Mandir but keep walking straight ahead past a government forest check post, towards Mahuli Village. Walk through the village and about five minutes later reach the Shiva temple right at the base of the fort. One can drive right up to this temple, though the road at many places is quite bad and narrow. There is a well with perennial drinking water in the temple compound. Locally made tea, snacks, lunch made by villagers may be available on weekends. Night halt can be made at this spacious and clean temple with the pujari's (temple priest) consent. 4&amp;nbsp;km brisk walk from Asangaon station will take you to the base temple in an hour. After the temple there are no human settlements towards the fort. Cross a seasonal stream, quite fast after an especially heavy downpour. Now the ascend begins along a prominent trail. A 3-hour trek with a prominent route will take you to the top-most plateau on the fort, which is actually a complex of three mountains and many pinnacles. There is a difficult-to-climb rock patch just below the plateau but in recent years an iron ladder has been placed to overcome this tricky part of the climb.

To get a close-up view of the many curiously shaped pinnacles from behind the fort, alight at Vasind Railway Station, go about 5 to 7 km on a narrow road keeping the mountain to your right. Go behind the fort, preferably with a local villagerâ€™s help, reach a remote place in the forest locally called â€˜Ambyache Paaniâ€™ (water at the mango tree). Water here is present throughout the year; one may have to dig the soil to reach water in the earth in the summer months from end-March to mid-June. For those venturing among the pinnacles, be wary of the numerous beehives hanging from overhangs on the vertical cliffs.

== History ==

The creator of this fort are Mughals. In 1485 this place came under rule Nijamshahi dynasty. When [[Shahaji]] Raje became the secretary of Nijamshahi, Mughals of Delhi tried to end Nijamshahi. In 1635-36, Shahaji Raje transferred himself with [[Jijabai]] and [[Shivaji]] to Mahuli. When Khan Jaman attacked the fort, Shahaji asked [[Portuguese in India|Portuguese]] for help, who refused and Shahaji surrendered.

Shivaji took this fort from [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s on 8 Jan 1658. In 1661 it was given back and was won again by Shivaji. In [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|treaty of Purandar]], in 1665, Marathas lost these forts again. In Feb 1670, Shivaji Maharaj tried to conquer Mahuli, but failed, Manohardas Gaud, was the in charge of the fort. A thousand Marathas were killed.Most of them were from nearby villages.Shivaji Maharaj said to his dead kadam sardar he is our gold. So maharaj gave sonare surname to this family. Manohardas Gaud, soon gave up his position and Alveerdi Beg took over. On 16 June 1670, after two months, Moropant Pingle conquered the forts and Mahuli, [[Bhandargad]] and [[Palasgad]] became part of Swarajya. Till 1817, Shivaji's dynasty owned the fort but later on it was controlled by the British Raj.

'''Udgir Fort''' in the [[Udgir]] city in [[Latur district]], [[Maharashtra]] of [[India]] is a fort built in pre-[[Bahamani]] age, dating from the twelfth century CE. It is also famous for the historic battle in which [[Marathas]], led by Sadashivrao Bhau, defeated Nizam, and after which the treaty of Udgir was signed.

There are many old military observation points, and rest houses scattered over the surrounding hills, all built from an unusual white clay. However, all have long since fallen into ruin. Udgir Fort may also have a deep underground tunnel connecting it with Bhalki and Bider forts.

The fort is bounded by a 40 feet deep trench, and contains several palaces, as well as the [[Samadhi]] of Udaygir Maharaj, which is 60 feet under the normal ground level. It was named after the Hindu Saint Udaygiri Rishi. It has some rare inscriptions written in Arabic and Persian which testify to the promotion of knowledge and culture by the local Muslim rulers over the centuries.

'''Balapur Fort''' is a in fairly good condition[[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] fortress situated in the town of [[Balapur, Akola district|Balapur]] in the [[Akola district]] of [[India]]. Construction on the fort was started by Mirza Azam Shah, the son of [[Emperor Aurangzeb]] and it was completed by Ismaeel Khan, the Nawab of [[Elichpur]] in 1757. The chhatri (umbrella-shaped pavilion); a canopy constructed by Mirza Raja Jaisingh, has an area of 25 square feet and a height of 33 feet. Its foundations were heavily damaged in a great flood called the 'dhvdya pur' which occurred more than 100 years ago, but after some years the damage was repaired at a cost of Rs 3,000 received from [[Jaipur]].

==History==
The old Gazetteer states, &quot;People are sufficiently educated to scrawl their names on all parts of the chhatri, and a stone in the middle has been coloured with the ubiquitous sacred red. The frivolous say that visitors to the chhatri must do three thing Firstly, they should note the char bot ki patthar, four-fingers stone, which has been set in near the top of a pillar on the soul. In 1616, Shah Nawaz Khan, the Subedar of Barar was camping at Balapur. the defeated Malik Ambar attacking him near [[Kirkee]] by way of Rohinkheda pass. But he could not hold for long and had to retreat to Balapur. Aurangzeb, after ascending the imperial throne at Delhi, appointed Raja Jaisingh as the Governor of the Dakkan. He constructed a very pretty chhatri, umbrella-shaped pavilion, 25 feet square and 33 feet in height at Balapur. Mirza Azam Shah, son of Aurangzeb, is said to have lived here and to have built a mud fort. It may be noted that as per the [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]], the Balapur pargana along with the Avandhe pargana was given in the name of Sambhaji as a Jageer and he was made a commandant of 5,000.

==Location==
The Balapur fort is situated in [[Balapur]], a large town located at the junction of the rivers [[Man river|Man]] and [[river Bhains|Bhains]], in west-central [[India]]. 

The old Gazetteer mentions that the town contained a mosque of 1737 in Kasarkhera. It further states, 'The mosque in Kasarkhera is a fair specimen of later Mughal architecture, but the arches arc too squat to be graceful; a long and somewhat bombastic inscription, exceedingly well executed and well preserved, gives as the date of construction of the mosque the year 1737. The mosque is known as the Raozah Masjid, for it contains the tomb of a local saint Maolvi Masoom Shah.' The old Gazetteer also states, 'A fine haveli in the town was built by a local saint, Sayyad Amjad, and an inscription over the principal gateway, a good specimen of Mughal architecture, conveys the information that it was built in 1703.'

Situated on an elevated ground between the two rivers, the fort has very high walls and bastions built of the best brickwork of its time. The fort has three gateways, one within the other. With [[Balapur]] hailed as an important military station during the times of the [[Mughals]], the fort too was built keeping in mind the town's military responsibilities and position. Complex architecture used in the fort ensured its safety, as well as eased the discharge of missiles and other ammunition from within the fort, rendering it one of the most impenetrable forts in the county.  During the rains, the Fort gets surrounded by floodwater except at one point. The temple of ''Bala Devi'', from which the town has derived its name, lies just under the Fort, on the southern side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Balapur Fort|url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/Forts.aspx?strpage=BalapurFort.html|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still in a relatively good condition, the Balapur Fort is now used by the government for offices. A quiet spot, this fort held supreme importance during the time of the Mughals.

'''Akola fort''' (also called Asadgad or Asagad) along with the [[Narnala]] and [[Akot fort]]s forms the major fortifications of the [[Akola district]], [[Maharashtra]], India.&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsofsahyadri.friendsofforts.com/list_of_maharashtraforts.htm|title=Friends of Forts|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In its earliest form of mud made by one Akol Singh to protect the village . He saw a hare chasing a dog and considering this to be an auspicious sign, he built an earthen wall here to protect the village. Akola was fortified majorly in 1697 CE during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] by Asad Khan,&lt;ref name=&quot;fof&quot;/&gt; from whom the fort took its name (Asadgad). In 1803, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] camped here before proceeding to win the Battle of [[Adgaon|Argaon]] in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annual&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackinston|first=J.F.|title=Annual Report of the Archeological Survey of India|publisher=Government of India|year=1927|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/annualreportofth030750mbp/annualreportofth030750mbp_djvu.txt|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress was dismantled by the [[British Raj]] in about 1870. It was reported in 1910 in a district gazetteer that the central part of the fort (the ''hawakhana'') was used as a school.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/AKOLA/places_Akola.html|title=Akola District Gazetteer|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major features ==
Akola fort is notable in that it is bereft of any decorative embellishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;annual&quot;/&gt;

There are several inscriptions on the fort. An inscription on the ''Dahi handa'' gate gives its date of constructions as 1114 AH (1697 CE), 'during the reign of emperor Aurangzeb when Nawab Asad Khan was minister.' Another on the Fateh Buruj bastion has no exact date. It too mentions the same minister but a different emperor (Shah Alam).&lt;ref name=&quot;annual&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt; One on the [[Eidgah]], contains texts and statement that the building was finished by Khawja Abdul Latif in  1116 AH (1698 CE). On the ''Agarves'' gate an inscription in Marathi reads that  Govind Appaji in 1843 CE constructed the fort. The latter statement contradicts all the other inscriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot;/&gt;

===Shri Raj Rajeshwar Mandir===
Akolaâ€™s oldest [[Shiva]] temple is Rajeshwar Mandir.

====Folklore====
While king Akolsingh was living in the Asadgad Fort, there is a famous story is associated with this payas temple. Every night his queen went to this temple to worship [[Lord Shiva]] at midnight. She had deep belief in Lord Shiva. Once king Akolsingh thought that his queen is going for a wrong reason in the midnight, so he followed her with a sword; the queen came to know that King Akolsingh was following her and thinking that she is walking in the midnight not for worship but for illicit work. She felt gloomy and guilty and went  straight went to the Shiva temple and pleaded the god that her husband the king was thinking wrong about her, and that it was insulting that he was having no faith in her loyalty and her character, so that she pleaded &quot;kindly get me into your Pind (Shiva [[Lingam|Ling]])&quot;, and suddenly the Shiva ling broke in two parts and the queen jumped into that ling and then it is closed. The king understood his mistake and could not forgive himself. Still the Shiva ling in this temple has a little crack which shows and proves the reality of ancient story. This temple is the base [[aastha]] of this Akola city.there are 2 bridges first one is the dagadi pool(stone bridge) and the other is lokhand pool(iron bridge).this rion bridge was built at the time of british.

'''Alang Fort''' (also ''Alangad'') is a '''[[fort]]''' in [[Nashik]] district, [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is one of the three forts, the others being [[Madangad (fort)|Madangad]] and [[Kulang (fort)|Kulang]], in the [[Kalsubai]] range of the [[Western Ghats]]. Alang, Madan and Kulang, the forts situated in Kalasubai range, are the most difficult forts in Nasik District. Dense forest and less population have made these treks difficult. These three forts are little neglected due to very heavy rain and difficult as well as confusing ways to go.

==Fascinating Spots==
Top of the fort is huge plateau. There are two caves on the fort for staying and 11 water cisterns. Remnants of buildings are spread over the fort. A small temple is also seen. From the fort we can locate Kalasubai, Aundh Fort, Patta, Bitangad situated at east zone. At north side Harihar, Trymbakgad, Anjaneri are seen. To the south we can locate Harishchandragad, Aajobagad, Khutta (pinnacle), Ratangad, Katrabai and surroundings. 4 hours are enough to see the fort.

==Ways To Reach==
===Igatpuri/Kasara-Ghoti-Pimpalnermor-Ambevadi===
To reach Alang, one should go to Kasara or Igatpuri and then Ambevadi by the Igatpuri/Kasara-Ghoti-Pimpalnermor route. Bus facility from Ghoti to Ambevadi is also available. Ambevadi is 32&amp;nbsp;km away from Ghoti. A bus is available at 6 a.m. from Ghoti to Ambevadi. We can easily see Alang, Madan and Kulang from here. From Ambevadi, a way goes to the ridge between Alang and Madan. However this way is quite hectic. Approximately 3 hours are required to reach near the ridge. From the ridge, the fort seen on left is Alang and the one on the right is Madan.

From here two ways go towards Alang. 
a) One way descends from the ridge. Within 1 hour we reach at the plateau. Keep Alang at left hand and after 1-hour walk, we reach a cavern. From here we can move further by rock climbing. Then we reach at a flat patch. Keep left and proceed towards the pinnacle. After 10â€“15 minutes we come at a cave in the fort. Time required to reach here from Ambevadi is approximately 8â€“9 hours.

b) Proceed from the ridge and after easy rock climbing we come near few steps. After ascending these steps we have to climb a broken pinnacle of 80â€“90&amp;nbsp;ft. Only trained climbers can go by this way. By this way we reach at the fort after 6 hours.

===Ghatghar via Ghoti-Bhandardara===
Another way towards fort is from Ghatghar. Go at Ghatghar via Ghoti-Bhandardara. From here, in 2Â½ hours, one can come to the third cavern.
Via Bhandardara from Udadvade :
Other way towards fort is via Bhandardara from Udadvade gaon. It takes us at the plateau and then connects to way no. (2).

==Accommodation Facility==
Two caves on the fort can accommodate 30-40 people.

==Food Facility==
We have carry with our own.

==Drinking Water Facility==
Ample water is available in reservoirs in all seasons Still, we have to carry sufficient water till we reach at the top.

==Time To Reach==
7â€“8 hours from Ambevadi

'''Sinhagad''', '''Sinhgarh''', or '''Sinhgad''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: à¤¸à¤¿à¤‚à¤¹à¤—à¤¡, ''The Lion's Fort''), is a fortress located roughly 30 kilometres southwest of the city of [[Pune]], [[India]]. Previously called Kondhana ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: à¤•à¥‹à¤‚à¤¢à¤¾à¤£à¤¾), the fort has been the site of many important battles, most notably the [[battle of Sinhagad]] in 1670. It was also strategically located at the centre of a string of other forts such as [[Rajgad]], [[Purandar Fort|Purandar]] and [[Torna fort|Torna]].

Perched on an isolated cliff of the [[Bhuleswar range]] of the Sahyadri Mountains, it is situated on a hill rising 1312 metres above sea level. Given natural protection by its very steep slopes, the walls and bastions were constructed at only key places; it has two gates â€“ the Kalyan Darwaza in the south-east and the Pune Darwaza in the north-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/Forts.aspx?strpage=KondanasinhagarhFort.html|title= Sinhagad Fort|accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Sinhgad entrance.jpg|thumb|The entrance to Sinhagad]]
This fort has had quite a long history, It was called 'Kondana' after the sage [[Kaundinya]]. The Kaundinyeshwar temple, the caves and the carvings indicate that this fort had probably been built two thousand years back. It was captured from the Koli tribal chieftain, Nag Naik, by [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]] in 1328 AD.
[[Image:View from Sinhagad Pune Darwaja.jpg|thumb|left|Sinhagad: View from the &quot;Pune Darwaja&quot;]]
[[Shahaji Bhosale]], as the commander of [[Ibrahim Adil Shah I]], was entrusted with the control of the Pune region. His son [[Shivaji]], however, refused to accept the [[Adilshahi]] and initiated the task of setting up Swarajya. He gained control of Kondana in 1647 by convincing Siddi Amber, the Adilshahi Sardar who controlled the fort. [[Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande]] played key role in this activity.In 1649, it had to be handed over to Adil Shah for Shahaji Maharaj's release. Shivaji Maharaj recaptured it back in 1656 again with the help of [[Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande]],who convinced Fort commander by giving land in newly created [[Shivapur]] village and  peacefully gained control of fort.This Fort saw attacks of Mughals on 1662, 1663 and 1665. In 1664, Shahistekhan- mughal general even tried to bribe people of fort to hand over the fort to him but he was unsuccessful. In [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Purandar Pact]] it went into the hands of the Mughal army chief Mirzaraje Jaysingh, in the year 1665. In 1670, Shivaji Maharaj re-conquered this fort and then it stayed under Maratha rule till 1689. After the death of [[Sambhaji]], the Mughals regained control over. Again in 1693 the Marathas recaptured it headed by Sardar Balkawade. [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Chatrapati Rajaram]] took asylum on this fort during Mogul raid on Satara but Rajaram died on Sinhagad on the 3rd of March 1700 &amp; in 1703 [[Aurangzeb]] conquered the fort. In 1706, it once again went into the hands of the Marathas. Pantaji Shivdev of [[Sangola]] and the Pant Pratinidhis played key role in this battle. Then this fort remained with Marathas till 1818, when the British conquered it. British however took three months to capture this fort. Which is highest time ever for them to win any fort in the [[Maharastra]].

===Battle of Sinhgad===
[[Image:Kalyan Darawaja on Sinhgad Fort.jpg|thumb|Kalyan Gate (à¤•à¤²à¥à¤¯à¤¾à¤£ à¤¦à¤°à¤µà¤¾à¤œà¤¾)]]
{{main|Battle of Sinhagad}}
One of the most famous battles for Sinhgad was fought to recapture the fort by [[Tanaji Malusare]], a general of [[Shivaji]] in March 1670. A steep cliff leading to the fort was scaled with the help of a [[Bengal monitor|monitor lizard]] named yashwanti, colloquially known as a ghorpad. Thereafter, there ensued fierce battles between Tanaji and his men, and the mughal army that had the fort at the time. Tanaji lost his life, but his brother Suryaji took over and captured Kondana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindubooks.org/sudheer_birodkar/hindu_history/landmaratha.html|title=Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the National Revival under the Marathas|author=Sudheer Birodkar|publisher=hindubooks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an anecdote that upon hearing of Tanaji's death, Shivaji expressed his remorse with the words: &quot;Gad aala pan sinha gela&quot; - &quot;We gained the fort, but lost the lion&quot;. The name Sinhgad, though, pre-dates this event, and can be seen in written communiques from the era. A bust of Tanaji has been established on the fort in memory of his contribution to the battle. It remains to this day a grand symbol of a great Maratha victory.

== Other details ==

Pune is well known for its forts and its hilly areas, which attract trek lovers in huge numbers. It has also been one of the eminent tourist spots in the state of Maharashtra. Holding historical structures like Shivneri Fort, Janjira Fort which is a unique fort covered with sea from all sides, Sinhagad Fort etc. Pune is also known as the cultural capital of the state. Sinhagad Fort is located to the southwest of Pune at a distance of 25&amp;nbsp;km. Trekking is the major attraction of the fort.

The fort forms the centre of all other forts Rajgad, Purandar and Torna surrounding it. 

The walls, the bastions and the slopes of the fort are built with tremendous idea providing natural protection and have been built at only some of the key points. The Fort has only two gates to enter the structure, the Kalyan Darwaza and Pune Darwaza which are positioned at the south east and north-east ends respectively.

Some of the information available at this fort portrays that the fort could have been built 2000 years ago. The caves and the carvings in the Kaundinyeshwar temple stand as proofs for the same. 
In 1328 AD, Muhammad bin Tughlaq captured the fort from Nag Naik, Koli tribal chief. Since this time, many rulers attempted to capture the fort and it went into the hands in regular intervals. Shivaji, the ruler of Marathas took over the fort in 1647.

Mughals gave a tough fight in capturing the fort, but Marathas never let the fort stay under any one for a long time. The fort was captured by other rulers and recaptured by Marathas at regular intervals, until the British finally captured it in 1818.

The fort is also significant for holding the memorials of Tanaji Malusare and Rajaram, younger son of Shivaji. Tanaji was a general of Shivaji who lost his life in the Battle of Sinhagad. Twentieth Century history reveals that one of the renowned Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak erected a bungalow above the fort.

Currently the fort serves as a training centre at National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla. And is the picnic spot for the Pune locals and trekking enthusiasts.

==Present day==
Parts of the once extensive fortification are now in ruins, but visitors still sense how the fort acted as an active military outpost. It is a popular weekend destination for many residents of Pune, with some enthusiasts trekking to the top of the fort from the base near Sinhgad village. The site also houses a memorial to Tanaji as well as the tomb of [[Rajaram, Chhatrapati|Rajaram]], Shivaji's younger son, who also died here.

'''Sajjangad''' ([[Devanagari]], Marathi: à¤¸à¤œà¥à¤œà¤¨à¤—à¤¡) meaning ''Fort of Good People'', is located near the city of [[Satara]], [[India]]. It is the final resting place of [[Samarth Ramdas|Sant Ramdas]], a saint and social reformer in 17th century India (born 1606). His teachings and works written in books such as Dasbodh &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dasbodh.com&lt;/ref&gt; are read and followed by many people even today in the state of Maharashtra and Sajjangad is a popular place of pilgrimage.

==History==
This for was known by the name of Asvalayana Rishi, since he lived here for many years in ancient times. Then it was called Aswalya gad due to the number of Aswals or bears wandering there.The fort was made by Bahamani Emperors in between (1347-1527). After that in (1527-1686) it came under Adilshah dynasty. Mughal king defeated Adilshah and the fort came under Mughal rule.
Previously known as Parali, it was renamed to Sajjangad after [[Shivaji|Shivaji Maharaj]] requested [[Samarth Ramdas|Shri Ramdas Swami]] to set up his permanent monastery.

==Present day==

The maintenance of the fort and the Samadhi (final resting place) of  Ramdas is taken care by  Ramdas Swami Sansthan, a trust which has existed since the time of Shri Ramdas Swami. The daily routine of the trustees on the fort includes morning prayers, Abhishek and Puja, Maha Naivedya, Bhajans and reading of the manuscript Dasbodh written by Sant Ramdas.

The fort is situated on the oval-shaped top of the hill. The eight-foot-high wall of the fort which encircled the hill top is still intact. Earlier several cisterns cut out of the rock ensured a plentiful supply of water to the fort but by 1957 most of them were in ruins. &lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot; /&gt;

In 1676, the fortifications were considerably improved by [[Shivaji]], subsequent to which it was known as one of the &quot;smallest yet strongest forts&quot; of the [[Maratha]]s. In 1844, the Samangad garrison rebelled and took over the fort, shutting the gates. But it was stormed by the [[British Raj]] under a General Delamotte and retaken from the rebelling soldiers. The British Raj dismantled the fort and it has been in ruins ever since. &lt;ref name=&quot;gaz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhapur.nic.in/KolhapurGazetteer/places_Samangad.html|title=Kolhapur District Gazette|publisher=Government of Maharashtra|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malhargad''' is a hill fort in western India near [[Saswad]], {{convert|30|km|mi}} from [[Pune]]. It is also known as '''Sonori Fort''' due to the village of [[Sonori]] being situated at its base. The fort was named for the god [[Khandoba|Malhari]] and was the last fort built by the [[Marathas]], about 1775.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=James|title=Lists of the Antiquarian Remains in the Bombay Presidency|publisher=Govt. Central Press|date=1885|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sahyadri range to the west of Pune in Velha taluka is split, and the forts Rajgad and Torna are on one branch while Forts [[Sinhagad]], [[Purandar]], [[Vajragad]] and '''Malhargad''' on the other. This range is known as the [[Bhuleshwar range]] which is spread along the East-West direction.  The fort is believed to be built to keep watch on [[Dive ghat]] along the Pune-Saswad route. The fort was built during the period of 1757 to 1760. The fort was built by BhivrÃ¢o Yashvant and Krishnaji MÃ¢dhavrÃ¢o PÃ¢nsÃª, a Peshwa Sardar,&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot; /&gt; who was the chief in charge of Tofkhana of the Peshwas. Citations of a visit of Elder Madhavrao Peshwe to the fort are available in historic documents. A palace, belonging to Panse, can be seen in the Sonori village though much of it is in ruins. 

The fort is in good condition. There are two temples constructed side-by-side: the smaller for Lord [[Khandoba]], and the larger for Lord [[Shiva|Mahadeva]]. From the top of this fort, the city of [[Jejuri]] and [[Parvati Temple|Parvati hills]] can be seen. The forts of [[Sinhagad]], [[Purandar fort|Purandar]], and [[Vajragad]] are also visible.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

'''Vairatgad fort''' is a [[fort]] situated near to the town of [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vairatgad.blogspot.com/ Vairatgad Fort] vairatgad.blogspot.com. Retrieved 2 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the fort is actually very small. There are remnants of old buildings. The [[bastion]] at the entrance is dilapidated. 5-6 cisterns can be seen to the left of the main gate, on the lower side of the cliff. There is a small cave to the right. At the top there is a Hanuman temple. An idol of [[Hanuman]] sits outside the temple. 

==History==
[[King Bhoj]] of the [[Shilahar Dynasty]] built Vairatgad in the 11th century. During [[Shivaji|King Shivaji]]'s reign the fort was used as a military station. [[Shivaji|King Shivaji]] conquered the Wai region and included Vairatgad and Pandavgad in his kingdom. The British captured it in 1818.

'''Avchitgad''' is a [[fort]] located in the [[Sahyadri]] ranges of [[Maharashtra]].  The fort is situated near [[Roha]] in the [[Raigad district]]. At the base of this fort is a village called Medha.

This fort is believed to be built by Shilahar kings and subsequently used by the Nizam of [[Ahmednagar]]. The great Maratha king Chhatrapati [[Shivaji]] is also believed to have reconstructed this fort. The work was carried out in a hurry and hence the name 'Avchit' (hurry) 'gad' (fort). In the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], this fort was won over by Colonel Prother from the [[Peshwa]]s in the year 1818 along with other forts in the neighbouring region.

The approximate height of this fort is 977 feet&lt;ref&gt;http://raigad.nic.in/DG/1964/places_Avchitgad.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fairly easy trek through the jungle up to the fort which takes about an hour to climb.  From atop the fort one can have a beautiful view of the neighbouring forts of Telbaila, Sarasgad, Dhangad, [[Sudhagad]], [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] and Savashnagad.

The fort has a large [[dodecagon]]al-shaped cistern which was used mainly for bathing and washing purposes. Nearby this cistern there are 6 smaller cisterns which have potable water.  A small temple of the Pingalsai goddess is also situated atop.

There is a dense forest around the entire fort with leopards, monkeys and foxes.

The Sitabuldi fort, which was the site of the '''Battle of Sitabuldi''' in 1817, is located atop a small hillock in the middle of [[Nagpur]], in central [[India]]. The fort was built by [[Mudhoji II Bhonsle]], also known as Appa Sahib Bhosle of the [[Nagpur kingdom|Kingdom of Nagpur]], just before he fought against the British [[East India Company]] during the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. The area surrounding the hillock is now known as [[Sitabuldi]] and is an important commercial hub for Nagpur.&lt;ref name=&quot;The great Nagpur boom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/cms/print.jsp?docpath=//money/2007/mar/17nagpur.htm|title=The great Nagpur boom|first=Ravi Teja Sharma|date=17 March 2007|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of the hillock is [[Nagpur Railway Station]] and at its back is a temple of [[Ganesha]] (''Tekdi Ganapati'').

==Battle of Sitabuldi==
 
The Sitabuldi Fort is one of the major tourist attractions in Nagpur. The Fort is situated on two hillocks: &quot;Badi Tekri&quot;, literally meaning &quot;big hill&quot;, and &quot;Choti &quot;Tekri&quot;, meaning &quot;small hill&quot; in Hindi. It is said that Sitabuldi got its name from two Yadavvanshi brothers -- Shitlaprasad and Badriprasad Gawali, who ruled the area in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. The place came to be known as &quot;Shitlabadri&quot;, which during the British rule became &quot;Seetabuldee&quot; and later assumed its current form &quot;Sitabardi&quot; or &quot;Sitabuldi&quot;. It is on these two twin hillocks that the Battle of Sitabuldi was fought in Nov 1817 between the forces of Appa Saheb Bhonsle of Nagpur and the British.

The Sitabuldi hills, though barren and rocky in those times, were not entirely unoccupied.

After the death of Shivaji on 3 April 1680, the Maratha empire disintegrated into five families, viz. the [[Peshwas]] of [[Satara]], [[Gaekwad|Gaekwads]] of [[Baroda]], [[Holkar|Holkars]] of [[Indore]], [[Scindia|Scindias]] of [[Gwalior]] and [[Bhonsle|Bhonsles]] of Nagpur. However, the Maratha confederacy, as the five families were known, was still a formidable force to reckon with.

During 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, the Marathas tried to overcome the gradual supremacy of the East India Company. The British too fervently prepared to suppress the Marathas. In the beginning of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, during the second [[Anglo Maratha war]], the British met with successes and annexed the territories of Marathas.

The second Anglo Maratha war involved five sets of battles: three major ones against the Scindias, Holkars and Bhonsles and two minor ones in [[Bundelkhand]] and [[Orissa]]. The campaign opened with the capture of [[Ahmednagar]] by Arthur Wellesly on 12 August 1803, followed by the capture of Burhanpur,Asirgarh and a victory over the Bhosla at Argon on 29th Nov 1803. The Bhosla signed a treaty at Deogaon by which he surrendered cuttack and all territory west of river Wardha to the British and agreed to receive a British resident at Nagpur.

The next great spurt in the expansion of the British in India took place between 1813 and 1823. In 1813 the Marquis of Hastings assumed charge of Government of India from Lord Minto and soon after began to make dispositions for the suppressions of the hordes of pindaris and other marauders that infested Central India. The ruler of Nagpur at that time was Raghuji II and the conclusion of a defensive treaty with him formed a part of the arrangements contemplated. Raghuji II, however rejected the terms offered to him.

Raghuji II died in March 1816, Mudhoji, better known as Appasahib, ascended the throne of Nagpur in April 1817 and entered into subsidiary alliance in May 1817. A subsidiary force was formed in accordance with this treaty and was maintained in or about Nagpur. Appasahib was however not comfortable with the alliance and went over to the views of the Poona court.

On 23rd Nov 1817, Appasahib made known to the residents his intention of receiving on the following day a 'Khilat' sent to him by the Peshwa which would make him ' Sena Saheb Suba' or &quot; Senapati' of Marathas. He requested that the resident should honour the occasion by his presence. He also requested that a salute should be fired in the British Cantonment on the auspicious occasion. As at this very time the British were at war with the Peshwa, it was clear that Appasahib's request could not be.acceded to Mr Jenkis, the resident at Nagpur notified Appasahib that his request under the circumstances was highly offensive to the British Government.

On 24th Nov 1817, Appasahib publicly received the 'Khilat' sent to him by the Peshwa and also accepted a commission from Poona, appointing him 'Senapati' of the Maratha armies. he then mounted his elephant and addressed his principal Sardars, telling them that his honour was now in their hands and that he placed his trust in them alone. Surrounded by his troops he proceeded to the camp at Sukhardara. The ' Jaripataka'  or royal standard was displayed, the army drawn up, salutes fired from the artillery stations around the camp, and in short nothing was omitted which could add to the pomp of the ceremony.

On the morning of 25th Nov 1817, all communications between the residency and the city was prohibited, the resident ' Harakars' were refused permission to carry a letter to the darbar, the markets were shut against the English troops. Events had taken a serious turn and inspire of grave provocation the resident decided to delay taking any decisive measures.

Towards noon of 25th Nov a body of about 2000 of the Bhosla horse left their camp at Bokur, five miles North East of the city and approached the residency. The cavalry commanded by Subedar Ganpat Rao got under arms and reports were spread around that the Pindaris were in the neighbourhood and threatened Nagpur. The city now became a scene of consternation, confusion and alarm, not that the people believed that tere was any danger from the Pindaris, but because Appasahib's design of atitacking the British and driving them out of his dominions was publicly talked about and universally credited. The alarm had now spread to the market frequented by the people of the residency which soon became almost deserted and indeed all classes both rich and poor, removed their families and property from the vicinity of Sitabuldi.

The resident now knew that the attack on the residency was now imminent. He sent orders to Lt Col Scott at about 2 pm, to march immediately from his cantonment at Telankheri,. The force arrived near the residency and occupied the twin hills of Sitabuldi. This movement was executed only just in time for a strong body of Arabs who were a part of the Maratha army, stationed in a village (where now stands the Railway Station of Nagpur) were awaiting final orders to secure this position. Express messages were also sent to General Doveton to come immediately with the Second Division of the Army from Berar.

===The Battleground===

The  high ground of Sitabuldi consists of two hills ( Badi Tekri to the South and Choti Tekri to the North) which are joined by a narrow saddle about 300 yards in length. The trig height of Badi Teri is 387m. The whole surface was rock and devoid of trees so it was not possible in a short time to dig any entrenchments on the two hills. Choti Tekri in the North is lesser in height but being within musket range of the Badi Tekri, it's possession was vital. More significantly the suburbs of the city came close to the lower hill (Choti Tekri). The present 118 Infantry Battallion (Territorial Army) GRENADIERS has made the hills green over a period of time.

===Deployment of Troops===

The forces on both sides were not equally matched. Marathas had amassed 18,000 troops including one third Arabs with 26 guns ( at some places 36 guns have been attributed to Marathas) The British had a brigade of two battalions with depleted strength of Madras Native infantry under Lt Col Scott, two loose coys, some cavalry and four guns. The total strength was about 1800 troops.

The Force - Britishers
* A brigade of two Battalions of 20 and 24 Madras Native Infantry
* Two companies of Native Infantry
* Three troops of Bengal Native Cavalry
* Four six pounder guns marines by Europeans of the Madras Artillery
* Resident Escorts (British Imperial Army)

The Force - Marathas
* Infantry - About 18000 troops
* Cavalry - 2000 Maratha Cavalry
* Artillery - 26 Guns

Disposition of British Troops - 26 Nov 1817
* Chotti Tekri - 24 Battalion Madras Native Infantry with one 6 pounder gun
* Badi Tekri - 20 Battalion Madras Native Infantry with two 6 pounder guns
* Residency - This area had Resident Escorts, Three troops f Bangal Native Cavalry, Two Infantry Companies and one 6 pounder gun

===The Day of the Battle===

Twin hills were occupied on 25th Nov 1817. Badi Tekri was occupied by about 800 men under Lt Col Scott. About 300 men of the 24th Regiment under capt Saddle were posted on the Choti Tekri with one 6 pounder. On the other side of the suburbs of the city gave cover to the Maratha troops, especially the Arabs ( Mercenaries) who throughout on the 26th Nov were gathering in large numbers. On the evening of 26th Nov 1817, the Arabs began the battle from the village by opening fire on the lower hill ( Choti Tekri). The engagement lasted till the early hours of the morning when it slackned  somewhat on the side of the Marathas. Several times during the night.the Arabs had tried hard to carry the lower hill. Although they were repulsed, they inflicted heavy casualties on the defenders. Capt Saddle was killed by a shot while defending lower hill. Time after time as the ranks of 24th Regiment were thinned , help was sent down from the 20th Regiment occupying the upper hill. At dawn on 27th Nov the British troops were holding on desperately to an isolated position.about 18000 men of whom nearly one quarter were Arabs, we're drawn up against them. At 5 O' clock in the morning the few remaining men of the 24th Regiment being utterly exhausted, we're withdrawn. Their place was taken by the Residents Escorts with orders to confine their defence to the summit of the lower hill. The fight continued till 9 O' clock the next morning when the Arabs again charged home. Just as they gained the crest, the accidental explosion of a tumbril caused considerable confusion amongst the defenders. They captured the hill and turned the gun which fell into their hands, against the higher hill position.

The Maratha Cavalry and Infantry taking advantage of this began to close in from all sides and started preparing for a general assault. To add to the confusion the Arabs broke into the huts of the English troops and started ransacking the place. A body of Maratha horse entered the residency compound. It was at this time that Capt Fitzgerald performed that gallant action which entitles a man to distinction. This brave officer, in command of three troops of the Bengal Cavalry and some horseman of the resident escorts had been repeatedly requesting permission to charge  and was as often, prevented by orders from the Commanding Officer. Seeing the impending destruction he made a last attempt to charge. Col Scott's reply was &quot; Tell him to charge at his peril&quot;. &quot;At my peril be it&quot;, said Capt Fitzgerald on receiving this answer and soon charged the principal body of the horse, drove them away from two guns by which they were supported, pursued them to some distance, cut a body of Infantry accompanying them to pieces and bought back the captured guns. The infantry posted on the hill witnessed this gallant exploit with loud cheers and the men, became freshly animated. Just then another explosion of ammunition took place amongst the Arabs on the lower hill. This was indeed fortunate for the British troops, officers and men together rushed forward, irresistible, they pursued the Arabs down the hill, took two of their guns, spiked them and returned to their position. The Arabs rallied again and evinced a determination to recover their ground. As they were getting ready to come up, a troop of cavalry under Colonel Smith charged round the base of the hill, took the Arabs in the flank and dispersed them. The British troops now advanced from the hill, drove the infantry from the adjoining hills and by noon the conflict had wholly ceased.

The British lost 367 killed and wounded including 16 British Officers. Among the killed wee Mr Sotheby's of the civil services who had been with the resident throughout the engagement.

==During the British Raj==
The graves of British soldiers who died in the battle of Sitabuldi remain in the fort. After the crushing of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]], [[Tipu Sultan]]'s grandson Nawab [[Kadar Ali]] and his eight associates were hanged on the ramparts of Sitabuldi fort for fighting against the British East India Company. A mosque is maintained in the fort to mark the hangings. The graves along with the mosque are maintained by the Indian Army as a mark of respect for the gallantry of all those who died. A memorial has also been constructed to the soldiers who fell during the colonial period.

[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] was imprisoned in the fort from 10 April to 15 May 1923. [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] of the United Kingdom gave audience to the people of Nagpur from the fort during their visit to British India. A pillar to commemorate the event stands in the fort. The royals were greeted by a huge crowd gathered at the area towards the present Nagpur Railway Station.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time &amp; History&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Nagpur/Time__History/articleshow/2732891.cms|title=Time &amp; History|first= Shishir Arya|date=26 Jan 2008|work=Times of India |location=India|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anjaneri''' is one of the important fort in the mountain range of [[Nasik]]-[[Trimbakeshwar]]. Anjaneri is located 20&amp;nbsp;km away from Nasik by Trimbak Road.

==History==

Nasik is a paradise for tourists. The city is famous for its pleasant climate and picturesque surrounding. Anjaneri is one of the exquisite attractions of Nasik city, which is also an important fort in the Trimbakeshwar region.Situated at 4264&amp;nbsp;ft above sea level, Anjaneri is a spiritual place that lies between Nasik and Trimbakeshwar.
 	
Anjaneri is birthplace of God [[Hanuman]]. Anjaneri fort is named after God Hanuman's mother 'Anjani'.&lt;ref name=&quot;MustSee&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title= Anjaneri, Trimbakeshwar | work= | publisher=Must See India | url=http://www.mustseeindia.com/Trimbakeshwar-Anjaneri/attraction/14034 | accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anjaneri has major significance for devout and hikers alike. God Hanuman spent his childhood and grew up on the same mountain. 

108 [[Jain]] caves are found here.

[[File:11TH Rudra Shiva Hanuman.jpg|thumb|right|As Hindu Mythology says, He was the incarnation of Lord Shiva the God of Destruction, the Third god of Hindu trinity (All this universe is in the glory of God, of Shiva, the God of Love. The heads and faces of men are His own and He is in the hearts of all - Yajur Veda). He is beleived to be 11th Rudra (Shiva) avatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutshiva.com/hanuman_jayanthi.php |title=AboutShiva.com - About Shiva - Hanuman Jayanthi |publisher=About Shiva |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Birthplace Controversy==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Anjaneri is logically and by sacred Hindu Texts the birthplace of Hanuman due to Hanuman being the Panchmukhi Hanuman held sacred as the 11th Rudra of Shiva.As Anjaneri is situated very close to the Jyotirlinga of Shiva , having powerful significance of the Trinity , represented by the three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu &amp; Lord Mahesh(Shiva) at Trimbakeshwar ;it is unquestioningly the birthplace of God Hanuman. 
Secondly ,only as the 11th Rudra is God Hanuman the embodiment of Shiva ,and this image is Panchmukhi.This form of Hanuman as &quot;Sri Panchamukha Anjaneya Swami&quot; (Anjaneya = &quot;son of Anjani&quot;) is more famous in the South and some other parts of the world. Some of the famous places where this form is seen are: Kumbakonam and Thiruvallur, both in Tamil Nadu.

Unlike Dattatreya who was born with three heads, or Ravana with ten heads, Hanuman was indeed born with one head. So where does this concept of a 5-headed Hanuman come from?

It happened during the war between Rama and Ravana's armies in Lanka. As it so happens, two powerful rakshasa brothers Mahiravana and Ahiravana are fighting on the side of Ravana. In some scriptures they are said to be Ravana's sons and are summoned by their father to help him after many of Ravana's warriors and generals are killed. 

Mahiravana is the ruler of the Patalpuri (Patala i.e. Hell). Now Mahiravana, being a powerful practitioner of dark arts and magic (known to be a great devotee of Goddess Kali) locates Rama and Laxmana by his magic. Mahiravana disguises himself as King Dasharartha, and gets past Hanuman's fortress who is guarding them. He captures Rama and Laxmana while they are sleeping, drags them down and holds them captive in his palace in Patala. 

Mahiravana leaves a trail behind, which goes deep into the bowels of the earth. Searching for them, Hanuman reaches Patala whose gates are guarded by a creature called Makardhwaja. Hanuman subdues him and ties him up before entering Patalpuri to rescue Rama and Lakshmana.

Upon entering Patala, Hanuman discovers the two brothers held captive meant as sacrifice to Goddess Kali, and also that in order to kill Mahiravana, Hanuman must simutaneously extinguish five lamps burning in five different directions. Thus, Lord Hanuman assumes the Panchamukha or five-faced form of:

1. Sri Varaha facing the North.

2. Sri Narasimha facing the South.

3. Sri Garuda facing the West.
 
4. Sri Hayagriva (a much earlier Avatar of Vishnu) facing the sky.
  
5. His own (Hanuman) facing the East.

Thus equipped with the five faces, Hanuman blows out the lamps, kills Mahiravana (in some versions, he sacrifices the demon himself to Goddess Kali, thus earning her favor by virtue of which she made Hanuman her doorkeeper - Indeed many temples of the goddess are seen to have a monkey guarding their doorways) and thus rescues Rama and Laxmana.

To this day, Hanuman is invoked in any fight against sorcery, and amulets and charms depicting him are therefore extremely popular among devotees.

Some popular folklore has a different version in which Mahiravana is killed, but that does not explain Hanuman's five faces.

==Ways To Reach==

The primary way to reach the Anjaneri fort is from Anjaneri village. One should get down at Anjaneri Phata, which is 20&amp;nbsp;km away from Nasik on the Nasik-Tryambakeshwar road. Anjaneri village is at a walking distance of 10 to 15 minutes from Anjaneri Phata. Two pinnacles called â€˜Navaraâ€™ and â€˜Navariâ€™ can be seen from Anjaneri village. The way to fort goes through Anjaneri village itself. Next to that there are some steps, through which we reach the plateau of Anjaneri. It takes almost one and the half hour to reach this plateau from Anjaneri village.

==Birthplace of God Hanuman==

Anjaneri is a scenic village with mythological importance and spectacular history. From Anjaneri village, it takes about one and half hour to reach the plateau of Anjaneri. This path leads to a magnificent trekking adventure through diverse sceneries of Anjaneri Lake, caves, waterfalls, Healing Lake etc.

Anjaneri Mountain, around 20&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nasik]], near Trimbakeshwar, is the birthplace of Hindu God Hanuman. A temple dedicated to Anjani, mother of Hanuman is located here. The temple attracts more than 100, 000 devotees during Hanuman Jayanti. The place also attracts large crowd on Tuesdays and Saturdays.The temple is located in the Sahyadri Mountain Ranges and is around 20&amp;nbsp;km from Nashik. The temple is near Trimbakeshwar.

It takes only 10 minutes to reach the temple of Anjani Mata from the plateau. This temple is quite big. You can see two different ways at a certain distance from Anjani Mata temple; one way to the left hand side that takes you to Seeta cave in 10 minutes. There are two rooms in this cave where almost 10 to 12 people can stay comfortably. There are many beautiful carvings inside Seeta cave. The other way takes you to Citadel, where you can see one more temple of Lord Hanuman and Anjani Mata. It takes 20 minutes to reach this temple.Anjani Temple is built in stone and is situated 4,200&amp;nbsp;ft above sea level.The right way ahead of the Anjani Mata temple leads directly to the citadel of Anjaneri fort in 20 mins. Here one more big temple of Anjani Mata can be seen. The overall area of Anjaneri is vast.

The place is surrounded by mountain ranges , forests and green landscapes . â€œAnjaneriâ€ is derived from the fact that God Hanuman is son of Anjani mata, the wife of Pavan. Anjaneri fort is one of the important forts in Tryambakeshwar range.It is located in the beautiful and hilly terrain of Anjaneri Hills-part of the Sahyadri Range in the state of Maharashtra.The 400 meters drive through the Anjaneri village is bound to remind visitors of the state of most Indian village roads. It is quite patchy with many ups and downs, indicative of the nature of human existence, with its joys and sorrows juxtaposed at most times in our lives. The Hanuman Jayanti fair at Anjaneri Village is famous for jatra (procession) and wrestling.
A 10 minutes walk from the temple to the left side takes one to the Sita Cave, another place associated with Ramayan.

==Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga==

A 28&amp;nbsp;km (18 mile) journey from pilgrim town Nashik takes a tourist to Trimbakeshwar, 10th sacred Jyotirlinga in the Dwadash Jyotirlinga circuit. The place is memorable due to its picturesque hills, roads and cool breeze . This hill station like place lies in the formidable shadow of Brahmagiri hills in the Sahyadri range and it is the source of holy river Godavari. The place is also known for its Simhastha Kumbha Mela, which comes every 12 years as per the Hindu calendar.

What makes the Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga unique is that it has three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu &amp; Lord Mahesh(Shiva). All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The temple is known for its appealing architecture and sculpture.

Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga is in a small hollow space, which contains a pot of water. Water from the river Godavari constantly pours on the top of linga. The Jyotirlinga is unique as it has three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu &amp; Lord Mahesh (Shiva).Generally the Jyotirlinga has a silver cover on festive occasions it is adorned with a golden cover of five faces each with a golden crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyotirlingas.com/trimbakeshwar-jyotirlinga.html |title=Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga |publisher=Jyotirlingas.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anjaneri's Association to Brahmagiri==

Brahmagiri(1298 meters)is to the west of Trimbakeshwar and this fort offers a commanding view of the Jawhar Mokhada region of Thane district.Trimbakeshwar itself is a place of worship because it is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of God Shiva.

From Trimbakeshwar,through regular steps, Ganga dwar is reached and the Gorakshanath cave which is end of Trimbakeshwar.Now again while climbing down,there is a road going towards Brahmagiri towards right.Following this route one reaches the carved steps in the rocks.The steps are very good even in the recent times.They were blown off by Britishers in 1818 but later on, they were rebuilt somewhere before [[India]] gained independence.From the base village,Brahmagiri is around 450 to 500 meters elevated

From base village,it takes 45 minutes to see Ganga dwar,the Gorakshanath caves and 108 Swayambhu Mahadev caves and in the halfway while descending,the road towards Brahmagiri takes you till the top in around 45 minutes and almost 2 hours to see the fort completely.There are 2 temples on this fort the place which is believed to be the origin point of Godavari river.From here,the river flows till Ganga dwar and then towards Kushavart teerth in Trimbakeshwar village.

One can reach this place by an ascent of about 750 steps made on concrete. There is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Ganga. The river appears here as coming out from the mouth of Nandi. Kolambika Devi temple and a group of 108 shivalings are seen nearby.

'''Purandar fort''' (also called Purandhar fort) à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤‚à¤¦à¤° à¤•à¤¿à¤²à¥à¤²à¤¾ (in Marathi) figures repeatedly in the rising of Shivaji against the [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]] kingdom and the [[Mughals]]. Purandhar fort stands 4,472&amp;nbsp;ft. above the sea (1,387 m) in the [[Western Ghats]], 20 miles southeast of [[Pune]]. It actually consists of two forts - Purandar and Vajragad (or Rudramal). The latter is the smaller of the two and is on the eastern side of the main fort. The village [[Purandar]] takes its name from this fort.&lt;ref name = express&gt;[http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/Default.aspx?strpage=../MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/PurandarFort.html  Maharashtra state tourism site]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Murarbaji.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Murarbaji Deshpande at Purandar Fort]]
The earliest known mention of Purandar is in the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadava]] era (11th century). The 1000yr old Narayaneshwar temple of [[Hemadpanthi]] architecture built by the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadavas]] still exists in Narayanpur, the base village of Purandar. After the defeat of the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadavas]] by Persian invaders, the territory fell in to the hands of these invaders who further fortified Purandar in 1350. During the early rule of the [[Ahmednagar_State#Bijapur_sultanate|Bijapur]] and [[Ahmednagar_State#Ahmadnagar_sultanate|Ahmednagar]] kings, Purandar was among the forts directly under Government, and never entrusted to ''jagirdars'' (estate-holders).&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometime under the Bedar kings (1347-1490) the fort was besieged several times. To prevent Purandar fort from falling, a man and a woman were buried alive under one of the fort bastions to appease its patron deity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Solapur/appendix_c.html#1  Sholapur District Gazetteer]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Purandar Fort church.jpg|thumb|Abandoned church, Purandar fort]]
In 1596, when [[Bahudar Shah]] of Ahmednagar sultanate granted [[Maloji Bhosale]](grandfather of [[Shivaji]]) Poona and Supa, the fort of Purandar was included as well. In 1646, a 19-year-old Shivaji in one of the first victories of his legendary career, established control in the fort.  In 1665, it was besieged by the forces of [[Aurangzeb]], under the command of Mirja Raja Jai Singh, a Rajput general, assisted by Diler Khan, an Afghan. The defense of Purandar by [[Murarbaji Deshpande]] of Mhar, the ''killedar'' (keeper of the fort) was obstinate and he lost his life in the struggle to retain the fort. Raja Shivaji daunted at the prospect of the fall of his grandfathers fort, signed a treaty (the first [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]]) with Aurangzeb. Purandar fort along with [[Vajragad]], [[Sinhgad]] and 22 other forts came under the Aurangzeb's control and Shivaji Raje became his ''jahagirdar'' (glorified tenant). This truce did not last long as Shivaji revolted against Aurangzeb and recaptured Purandar only five years later in 1670. Thereafter, Shivaji spent prolonged periods of time here. [[Sambhaji raje]], Shivaji Maharaj's eldest son and successor was born at Purandar fort.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; 

Under the Peshwas, Purandar was a stronghold to which they retreated whenever Pune, their capital, was under attack. Likely because the fort commands a pass through the [[Sahyadri]] mountain range. In 1776, a treaty was signed between the British Government and the Maratha States(the second [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]]). Its conditions were never fulfilled, being overruled by the subsequent [[Treaty of Salbai]] in 1782 between the Bombay Government and [[Raghunathrao]], at the close of the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]].&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; 

In 1818, Purandar was invested by a British force under General Pritzler. On the 14th of March, a British garrison marched into Vajragad the smaller fort. As Vajragad commanded Purandar, the commandant had to accept terms and the British flag was hoisted at Purandar on the 16th March, 1818.

It is also said that Purandar is the broken part of the Dronagiri Parvat which Hanuman was carrying in Ramayana.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; 

[[Image:Purandareshwar Temple.jpg|thumb|Temple of the Purandeshwar deity from which Purandar takes its name]]

During British rule it was used as a prison. A German prisoner Dr. H. Goetz was kept here during World War II. He studied the fort during his stay there and later published a book on it. It major use however was as a [[sanatorium]] for British soldiers.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

== Structures within the fort ==

The fort has two distinct levels.  The lower part is called the ''machi''. North of the machi is a flat area where the cantonment and hospital was housed. There are many temples decicated to Purandareshwar (the fort's patron god, from which it also takes its name) and Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa here. There is a statue of [[Murarbaji Deshpande]], the fort-commander (''killedar'') who gave his life to protect the fort from the [[Mughals]]. The northern part of the machi has a low fall with several bastions and an imposing gate with two towers.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; 

From the lower level a staircase leads to the upper level or Ballekilla.  The first structure of the Ballekilla that comes into view is the Dilli Darwaza.  This area also houses an ancient Kedareshwar ([[Shiva]]) temple. The higher level called ''Ballekilla'' is surrounded by steep drop on three sides.

== Current use ==

Purandhar fort has a [[National Cadet Corps (India)|National Cadet Corps]] Academy. It is a favorite destination for [[paraglider]]s and [[backpacking (wilderness)|trekkers]].&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

[[Image:Ajinkyatara entrance.jpg|upright|thumb|Entrance to Ajinkyatara fort]]
'''Ajinkyatara''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: à¤…à¤œà¤¿à¤‚à¤•à¥à¤¯à¤¤à¤¾à¤°à¤¾, meaning &quot;The Impregnable Star&quot;) is a fort on one of the seven mountains surrounding the city of [[Satara]] in the [[Sahayadri]] Mountains of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is a 16th Century [[fort]] and now also holds the television tower for the city of Satara. This fort has been the place where several pivotal moment in Maratha history took place.

The fort is located at Ajinkyatara Mountain, which is 3,300 feet high. As the fort is in the higher altitude, visitors can enjoy a magnificent view of the entire Satara city. There are number of water tanks inside the fort for storing water. So, there is no scarcity of water even as the fort is in the higher place

In 1708, Shahu Maharaj won Ajinkyatara, remained with the Marathas till 1818. The Ajinkyatara fort is a major historic place of Maharashtra, and was very vital as one could keep watch of the entire South Maharashtra. 

This was the place where [[Tarabai]] was imprisoned by Shahu.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat Tracks in Maharashtra|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2005|pages=66â€“68|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JIjmDLardesC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=ajinkyatara&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA68,M1|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=December 2012}}

The fortress is also mentioned in [[Nathmadhav]]'s novel ''Veer Dhaval'', in which the eponymous protagonist, a vassal of the [[Eastern Chalukyas|Chalukyas]], is the rightful master of the fort (and takes final possession of it at the novel's end) which has been under the misrule of his uncle Chanda Varma, who usurped the fort after murdering the protagonist's father Keerti Varma

'''Raigad''' is a hill fortress situated in the modern day near [[Mahad]], [[Raigad district]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. The Maratha king [[Shivaji]] made the fort his capital in 1674 when he was crowned King of a Maratha Kingdom which later developed into the [[Maratha Empire]] eventually covering majority of modern day India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/Forts.aspx?strpage=Raigarh_Fort.html|title= Raigarh Fort|accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort, which rises {{convert|820|m|ft|-2}} above sea level, is located in the [[Sahyadri]] mountain range. There are approximately 1737 steps leading to the fort, though today [[Raigad Ropeway|an areal tram]] exists to reach the top of the fort. The fort was looted and destroyed by the British upon siege.

==History==
[[File:The Ghats from Ryghur.jpg|thumb|left|The Ghats from Ryghur]]
Shivaji had seized the fort in 1656, then the fortress of Rairi, from the royal house of the Chandrarrao Mores, a junior or [[Cadet dynasty]] to descended from the ancient [[Maurya]] imperial dynasty. The last More king (or ''raja'') was a feudatory of the Sultan of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]]. Shivaji renovated and expanded the fortress of Rairi and renamed it Raigad (the ''King's Fort''). It became the capital of Shivaji's kingdom.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

In 1765 the Raigad Fort, along with [[Malwan]] in present [[Sindhudurg District]], the southernmost district of [[Maharashtra]], was the target of an armed expedition by the British [[East India Company]], which considered it a [[pirate|piratical]] stronghold.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

In 1818 the fort was bombarded and destroyed by [[East India Company]], using cannons.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

==Major features==
[[File:Dawn at Raigad fort.JPG|thumb|Dawn at Raigad Fort]]
The fort was built by Chandrarao Mores in 1030. Its ruins today consist of the queen's quarters: six chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the bases of pillars remain. Ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds overlooking an artificial lake called ''Ganga Sagar Lake'' created next to the fort. It also has a view of the execution point called ''Takmak Tok'', a cliff from which the sentenced prisoners were thrown to their death. This areas is now fenced off.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaji&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat Tracks in Maharashtra|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=2005|pages=41|isbn=81-7154-669-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JIjmDLardesC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=raigad+fort&amp;lr=|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort also has ruins of the market, and it has such structure that one can shop even while riding on a horse.

The fort has a famous wall called &quot;Hirakani Buruj&quot; constructed over a huge cliff. Its story is that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village at the foothills of Raigad had come to sell milk to the people living in the fort. She was inside the fort when the gates were locked by sunset. The love for her infant son back at her village gave her the courage to climb down the cliff in the dark. She repeated the feat in front of King Shivaji, and was rewarded for it. In appreciation of her courage, Shivaji arranged for a wall built at this location. Even today{{when|date=March 2013}} we can see it standing.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

The king's public [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called the ''Nagarkhana Darwaja''. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the ''Mena Darwaja,'' was supposedly the private entrance of the royal ladies of the fort; it leads to the queen's quarters. The erstwhile main entrance to the fort is the imposing ''Maha Darwaja''. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the ''Palkhi Darwaja.'' To the right of Palkhi Darwaja, is a row of three dark and deep chambers. Historians believe that these were the granaries for the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;ropewayinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|suraj mhatre

A statue of Shivaji maharaj is erected in front of the ruins of the main market avenue that eventually leads to the ''Jagdishwar Mandir'' and his own [[SamÄdhi|Samadhi]] (tomb) and that of his dog Waghya. The statue was removed by alleged members of the [[Sambhaji Brigade]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=73 held for removing Shivaji's dog's statue from Raigad fort|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_73-held-for-removing-shivaji-dogs-statue-from-raigad-fort_1723352|accessdate=4 August 2012|newspaper=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2012 as a protest but was re-instated by Shri Shivaji Raigad Smarak Samiti, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], sculptor Rambhau Parkhi and the District Administration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vaghyacha putala punha basavala|url=http://72.78.249.107/Sakal/3Aug2012/Enlarge/PuneCity/page8.htm|accessdate=4 August 2012|newspaper=Sakal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jivdhan''' (or '''Jeevdhan''') is a [[hill fortr]]ess situated 45&amp;nbsp;km near modern day town of [[Naryangoan]] in [[Junnar Taluka]] of [[Pune district]] in [[Maharashtra]], India. The fort, which rises 1145 meters (3754&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, is located in the Sahyadri mountain range. The fort was looted and destroyed by the British upon siege between 1815 -1818{{when|date=October 2012}} This is one of the forts known as 'Famous 5'. Chavaand, Hadsar, Shivneri, Jivdhan and Naneghat form the [[Famous 5]] trek. This is a high difficulty grade trek due to the misleading jungle tracks and the necessity and knowledge of using climbing equipment.

==History==
Forts originated during the [[Satvaahan]] era. Every entry point on the forts built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj have a 'Kalas' and Lord Ganesh carved on it. The nearby Naneghat (Toll collection booth) was used for commercial purpose by traders to help in easy movements of goods. As this was an important pass joing the seas to the mainland, it was heavily guarded from enemies. The Jivdhan fort stood as an important guard fort to protect the interests of various kingdom. Jivdhan to Naneghat has an open field of 2â€“3&amp;nbsp;km, which gives any clear indication of enemy approach. The British captured this fort in 1818 and destroyed all approaches. This fort was captured by Col. Prother of the East India company and later destroyed.

==Major Features==

===Storehouses===
There are some unexplored storehouse atop the fort which can explored with proper precautions.

===Water Tanks ===
There are a few water tanks atop the fort, water from these tanks is not portable as they are open all the year round. One should use caution while using this for cooking food or drinking.

===Pinnacle near the fort===
This is about 385 feet high. When you approach the fort it looks smaller in size but as you move closer to the fort you can actually get a feel of how high the pinnacle is. This pinnacle is known as 'Vanderlingi'. This is surmountable with use of proper rock climbing equipment. It may take a day or 2 to climb the pinnacle. One needs to scout the area for beehives in order to climb with complete control.

===North front===
Once you are at the top of the fort you can view various hilltops and forts nearby. You will clearly see forts like Harishchandragad, Chavaand, Ratangad, Naneghat, Manikdoh Dam and the entire Junnar plateau.

'''Kohoj''' is a

==Location==

Kohoj is located about 104&amp;nbsp;km from Mumbai off the Mumbai - Ahmedabad Highway.  Upon reaching Manor you have to take a right turn under a newly built flyover and take the Manor - Wada road.  A few minutes drive on this road and one can see the Kohoj fort on your right.  At the bottom of the fort is a lake known as 'Pazhar'.

==History==

The fort is said to be about 800 years old and finds a mention in the Purandar treaty along with 22 other forts which were surrendered by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals on 11 June 1665.

Kohoj has a moderately difficult gradient and it takes about two and a half hours to reach the main plateau from Vaghote village which is situated a the base of the fort.  To reach the highest point it takes another 10â€“15 minutes. The height of the fort is about 3200 feet.

Upon reaching the main plateau one can find a small temple of God Shankar. A little towards the right are two small water cisterns. These cisterns have potable water.  A few minutes walk towards the opposite side reveal several water cisterns.

On the path leading to the top of the fort there are three more cisterns and a stone idol of Lord Hanuman can be seen. Some evidence of fortification can be sighted as well.

Atop the fort is a stone structure which resembles a human figure. This human like figure can be seen from the main plateau as well as from the base of the fort. Towards the right of the human structure is a small temple of Lord Krishna. It also has an old mutilated stone deity which could not be identified.

==Accommodation Facility==

There is no residing place on the fort.  The temple of Lord Shiva can hardly accommodate two persons at a time.

[[Image:Pratapgad.jpg|thumb|300px|Pratapgad Fort]]
'''[[Shivaji]]''', founder of [[Maratha empire]] in [[western India]] in 1664, was well known for his forts; he was in possession of around three hundred at the time of his death. &lt;!-- Forts means Shivaji , this equation is well known through out Indian Subcontinent.--&gt; Many, like [[Panhala Fort]] and [[Rajgad]] existed before him but others, like [[Sindhudurg]] and [[Pratapgad]], were built by him from scratch. Also, the [[Raigad Fort|fort of Raigad]] was built as the place of throne, i.e., the capital, of Maratha Empire by Hiroji Indalkar (Deshmukh) on the orders of Shivaji. This is the holy place where Shivaji was coronated and today also his Samadhi stands in front of the Jagadishwar temple. These forts were central to his empire and their remains are among the foremost sources of information about his rule. The French missionary Father Fryer witnessed the fortifications of [[Gingee]], Madras, built by [[Shivaji]] after its conquest, and appreciated his technical knowhow and knowledge.

Sindhudurg was built in order to control attacks by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Siddhis]] on the coastal areas of the Maratha Empire. This fort is the witness of Shivaji's Navy which was later led by Kanhoji Angre in times of Shivaji's grandson Shahu I, and came to glory. Also Shivaji built the forts of Colaba and Underi to control the activities of the Siddhis in Arabian Sea. At the time of Underi's construction British opposed a lot and stood with their warships in the sea to obstacle the material being supplied for the construction of the fort. But for their surprise the material required for construction was being supplied with the help of small boats in night.

The hill fort [[Salher Fort|Salher]] in [[Nashik district]] was at a distance of {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from the hill fort Jingi, near [[Chennai]]. Over such long distance, hill forts were supported by seaforts. The seafort, [[Kolaba Fort]], near Mumbai, was at a distance of {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} from the seafort [[Sindhudurg]]. All of these forts were put under a havaldar with a strong garrison. Strict discipline was followed. These forts proved useful during Mughal-Maratha wars.

Along with Rana Kumbha of [[Mewar]] and Raja [[Bhoj]] of Shilahar, he stands as a grand figure in the art of fortification in Indian sub-continent. There are a number of legends about these forts. Even today thousands of youths visit these forts in his memory.

Notable features of Shivaji's forts include:

*Design changes with the [[topography]] and in harmony of the contour, no monotony of design
*No ornate palaces or dance floors or gardens
*No temple complexes
*Not much difference in the area of higher or lower ranks
*Marvelous [[acoustics]] in the capital
*[[Sanskritization]] of fort names
*Community participation in the defense of forts
*Three tier administration of forts
*System of inspection of forts by higher ups including the king
*Distinct feature of forts like double line fortification of Pratapgad, citadel of Rajgad
*Foresight in selection of sites

[[File:Janjira Fort or Kasa Fort.jpg|thumb|Kasa Fort]]
'''Padmadurg''', also known as '''Kasa fort''', is a [[fort]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It was built by the great Maratha ruler King [[Shivaji]] to the northwest of the fort [[Janjira]]. It was built mainly to conquer the fort Janjira, although it is not as big as Janjira. Due to incomplete construction, and bombardment from Janjira during its construction, only ruins of the Padmadurg fort remain. Many parts of the fort are now inaccessible and there are no direct ferryboats to Padmadurg. 
 
âˆ’	
This fort is under a seal by Indian Government as it has been claimed that the drugs were smuggled there. It was built by king Sambhaji - son of the great Maratha ruler king Shivaji. Although it is not as big as Janjira but still a sea fort that can be visited upon permission by Indian Customs\Navy. It looks great from Janjira.
 
âˆ’	
When Shivaji the Great decidied to take on the Siddis of Janjira, his admiral, Daulat Khan, built this fort on an island next to Janjira. The rock, on which the fort was built, was called Kasa and the fort was named Padmadurg. The fort has six bastions, some of them devastated by gun attack from the famous 'kalal bangdi' gun in Janjira. Kasa was soon overpowered by Siddis and used as a jail


Padmadurga a sea fort was buli infront of rajapuri in order to counter the siddi power. About this fort maharaj had said in a letter that by constructing padmadurg he had set up another rajpuri to overshadow the rajpuri of the siddis
